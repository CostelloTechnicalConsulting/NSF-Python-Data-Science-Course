         "Abstract\r\nAST 0415302\r\n\r\nMagnetic fields control the inconstant Sun. The key to understanding solar variability and its direct impact on the Earth rests with understanding all aspects of these magnetic fields. This is the ?dark energy? problem of solar physics since the magnetic fields lie beyond the resolution limits of current solar telescopes, are obscured by Earth's atmosphere, or hidden by the glare of the solar disk in the outer solar atmosphere. The Sun provides the laboratory where crucial properties of non-linear dynamics in highly ionized magnetic plasma can be observed and understood, and models can be tested and refined. The technology now exists to resolve and measure the Sun?s magnetic fields and how they control the solar atmosphere. All aspects of the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) design are optimized to study these fields in our astrophysical backyard.  With it, we will understand the life cycle of magnetic fields, how they are born by dynamo mechanisms, evolve by convective and explosive phenomena, and dissipated by resistive and reconnective magnetic events.  \r\n\r\nThe ATST will be a 4-m aperture, off-axis solar telescope with integrated adaptive optics, low-scattered light, infrared, coronagraphic, and polarimetric capabilities. It will resolve the essential, fine-scale magnetic features and their dynamics that dictate the varying release of energy from the Sun?s atmosphere. The ATST design is optimized (throughput, scattered light and instrumental polarization properties) to make vector magnetograms down to its diffraction limit (0.03 arcseconds at 500 nm). Its collecting area, which is a factor of 16 greater than today?s solar telescopes, will provide the sensitivity to measure both weak fields and rapidly evolving stronger fields. It has a factor of 64 greater collecting area than the largest existing coronagraph, and will provide the sensitivity and coronagraphic capability needed to measure the weak, fine-scale coronal magnetic fields. The new technologies, and our increased awareness of what we know we must learn, make ATST the necessary and logical successor to the solar telescopes built in the 1960s and 1970s, and is a natural complement to space missions such the Solar Dynamics Observatory, STEREO, and Solar Orbiter.\r\n\r\nThe ATST offers tremendous opportunity for the training of students and recruitment of post-docs and faculty in solar physics who will become users of the ATST and the instrument builders and theoreticians of the future. ATST plans to establish a strong synergy with the education and outreach programs at the collaborating institutions, including programs for the K-12 classroom, internships, public outreach through tours, hands-on exhibits, and displays. The ATST program has and will continue to actively involve large segments of the US and international solar physics community, helping to strengthen solar astronomy programs at universities and national centers.\r\n",

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will be the most powerful solar telescope and the world&rsquo;s leading ground-based resource for studying solar magnetism that controls the solar wind, flares, coronal mass ejections, and variability in the Sun&rsquo;s output.</p>\n<p>The Sun is the most important astrophysical object to humanity. It uniquely interacts with earth, driving processes in the terrestrial climate, as well as the environmental conditions in space around earth (space weather), which can profoundly impact out planet&rsquo;s communications, civil infrastructure, economies and biology. To investigate and ultimately understand and predict solar activity, we need to observe and model the physical processes throughout the solar atmosphere on their intrinsic spatial and temporal scales.

         "The 4m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will be the most powerful solar telescope and the worldÆs leading ground-based resource for studying solar magnetism that controls the solar wind, flares, coronal mass ejections, and variability in the SunÆs output.\n\nThe Sun is the most important astrophysical object to humanity. It uniquely interacts with earth, driving processes in the terrestrial climate, as well as the environmental conditions in space around earth (space weather), which can profoundly impact out planetÆs communications, civil infrastructure, economies and biology. To investigate and ultimately understand and predict solar activity, we need to observe and model the physical processes throughout the solar atmosphere on their intrinsic spatial and temporal scales. The science needs drive a design that supports diffraction-limited imaging and spectropolarimetry of all atmospheric layers from the photosphere to the corona over a range of wavelengths from the visible to the infrared.\n\nThe DKIST is a facility designed to provide these critical capabilities and lead to profound improvements in our understanding of solar magnetism. The funding from AST-0415302 provided the resources to complete the designs of the fundamental components of this facility as well as advance the fabrication of the principal subsystems.\n\nThe DKIST, directly and in combination with other space- and ground-based instruments, will address many long-standing questions that encapsulate the physics of solar activity and variability that we still donÆt understand but have a good chance of answering in the next few decades with the proper observational and theoretical tools. These questions are:\n\nWhat heats the solar corona, making the Sun a variable X-ray star?\nHow does the magnetized solar plasma accelerate the solar wind?\nWhat triggers solar mass ejections, converting pent up magnetic energy to magnetized clouds of plasma traversing the interplanetary space?\nHow is energy stored and released in solar flares?\nWhat role does the ubiquitous magnetic flux play in the solar dynamo process, leading to cyclic variation of magnetic activity?\n\n\nThe study of the Sun guides astronomers in their investigations of other stars, and was a major aspect of solar physics touched on by the New Worlds, New Horizons (NWNH) decadal survey.  As stated in NWNH (pp. 61, 64), \"to understand the lives of stars and the role they play in cosmic evolution we must understand the roles of mass loss, rotation, and magnetic fields in stellar evolution.\"  Magnetic fields play a role in both mass loss and rotation, and they also play a role in the evolution and destiny of life around stars through control of the radiation environment to which planets are subjected.  The latter touches on the habitability of planets (NWNH, p. 37).  A goal of the proposed NSO CA program is to understand the role of solar magnetic fields on all of its various scales using the DKIST and synoptic assets.\n\nSolar physics has entered a new age in which the coupling of advanced instrumentation and detailed modeling are challenging what solar physicists think they know about the Sun and the solar processes that affect life on Earth and govern interplanetary space. \nThe DKIST will be the worldÆs most advanced and capable solar telescope, reaching far beyond the limitations of current telescopes to study magnetic fields on the Sun as small as 25 km in size. Such resolution will allow solar physicists for the first time to observe the interactions of the starÆs convective envelope with magnetic fields and the possible generation of magnetic fields in a \"turbulent dynamo\" process that has been theorized but never observationally confirmed.\nThe DKIST will be the first high-resolution solar telescope to include the capability to observe the SunÆs elusive and superheated outer atmosphere or \"corona\", normally seen from the ground only during solar eclipses. This capability will allow scientists to explore the ph...",

         "Dr. Kennedy Reed has an extensive portfolio of work broadening the participation of women and minorities in STEM disciplines. Dr. Reed has been a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) since 1979, working on research in theoretical atomic physics. Throughout his career at LLNL, he has played a significant role in efforts to increase opportunities for minority students and professionals in the sciences. An important contribution has been the establishment of a national model for scientific collaborations linking leading scientists from a national laboratory with professors and students from Minority Serving Institutions. Through a program to bring together LLNL scientists, faculty from Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs) and other institutions serving predominantly minority students (MIs) the LLNL/HBCU/MI Program, has produced more than thirty scientific publications co-authored by LLNL scientists and HBCU/MI faculty and students. A significant number of student participants in the program have pursued advanced degrees, and many have entered the science and technology workforce. Dr. Reed initiated an undergraduate program at LLNL and has encouraged minority students to pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM disciplines. Many of these students have entered the STEM workforce. Recognizing that minority recruitment and retention in these disciplines posed challenges, he was instrumental in the creation of graduate fellowships at LLNL for students, and then helped to broaden those opportunities among the other national laboratories. In his commitment to broadening the participation of minority and female students in the physical sciences, Dr. Reed has succeeded in helping 100 of these students to earn their doctorates.\r\n\r\nDr. Reed has been instrumental in shaping the careers of numerous students through other activities such as the National Physical Science Consortium Fellows program and the National Society of Black Physicists Fellows. Dr. Reed's work has helped to broaden the participation of underrepresented students in STEM and enhance the research and academic infrastructure of Minority Serving Institutions. Through the efforts of the consortium, over 300 graduate fellowships have been awarded. He served as the Chair of the National Society of Black Physicists, and continues to chair its scholarship committee. Over 30 undergraduates have received scholarships.",

         "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0804541\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Gloria Mari-Beffa\r\n\r\nIn this project the PI proposes to research the existence of\r\ngeometric realizations for nonlinear biHamiltonian PDEs and the\r\nimplications of this existence for the biHamiltonian system and\r\nfor the realizing manifold alike. In particular she intends to\r\ndescribe possible realizing manifolds and to link their geometry\r\nto the type of system they realize. In the past the PI has\r\nstudied how biHamiltonian structures are generated by the\r\ngeometry of curves in realizing manifolds. She also studied\r\ngeometric realizations of equations of KdV type in Hermitian\r\nSymmetric manifolds, linking the projective character of\r\ndifferential invariants to equations of KdV-type. In this project\r\nshe proposes to deepen this relation and to expand it to\r\nparabolic manifolds. In joint work with M. Eastwood she will be\r\nusing tools in classical differential geometry to find projective\r\nstructures on flows. Resolving this differential geometry problem\r\nwill very likely create geometric realizations of KdV-type in\r\nparabolic manifolds. She will also investigate the possibility of\r\na similar connection in other geometries, for example that of\r\nSchrödinger, mKdV and sine-Gordon flows to Riemannian\r\ngeometry. Finally, in joint work with Calini and Ivey, the PI\r\nwill study geometric and topological properties of solutions to\r\nrealizations of soliton equations, in particular those\r\ncorresponding to finite-gap solutions (periodic case). The study\r\nwill try to link properties of these solutions to their spectral\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\nSetting an appropriate geometric background is often a\r\nfundamental step in the resolution of a problem.  A choice of\r\ngeometry establishes the properties and laws we wish to keep\r\nunchanged: Relativity (with Lorentzian geometry setting the\r\ninteraction between space and time) and computer imaging (using\r\nprojective geometry when 3D perspective needs to be preserved)\r\nare some of the best-known examples. But nowadays many engineers\r\nand physicists, including some groups working on data collection,\r\nconsider a basic knowledge of differential geometry to be\r\nfundamental. Geometric thought is commonplace, as often finding\r\nthe right choice of geometry for a problem is an initial step in\r\nits resolution - it all depends on how (or with which geometric\r\neyes) you look at it -. BiHamiltonian nonlinear equations are\r\nvery rich in structure and they are often used to model different\r\ntypes of phenomena. Their rich structure allows us to find a\r\ngreat deal of information about the system they model and to\r\npredict behavior. The best-known completely integrable systems\r\nare bi-Hamiltonian, and their solutions predict the behavior of\r\nfluids, from water waves in shallow water to the trailing\r\nvortices behind the wing tips of an airplane.  These phenomena do\r\nnot, in principle, exist within any given geometric\r\nbackground. When we find geometric realizations for a completely\r\nintegrable system we gain information in two different ways: 1)\r\nWe learn that the behavior of these phenomena can be visualized\r\nwithin a certain geometry, and we learn how to visualize it. In\r\nparticular, the same phenomena can be described in more than one\r\ngeometry; 2) We learn that some geometries are hosts to phenomena\r\nthat were not known to exist in that context before. For example,\r\nby linking projective and centro-equi-affine geometries, we can\r\nfind evolutions of star-shaped curves that behave like solitary\r\nwaves. The better we understand the relation between these two\r\napparently unrelated subjects, the more we can transfer our\r\nextensive geometric knowledge, their connections and properties,\r\nto the understanding of completely integrable systems. And\r\nvice-versa.",

         "The research that was conducted under this award is on the mathematical aspects of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics.  The mathematical theories describing classical and quantum mechanics are very different:  Classical mechanics is based on geometry, while quantum mechanics is based on analysis,  which is advanced calculus.  One is deterministic, the other probabilistic.  Yet there is a very deep connection between these two fields, and the outcomes of this project significantly add to the understanding of that connection.  They also uncover new aspects of the quantum-classical relationship.\n \nOur main results give some answers to the general question:  To what extent the vibrations of an object reflect its geometry?  In our setting vibrations refers to to the quantum energy levels, and we show that in a number of cases the quantum energy levels do determine much of the geometry, or classical mechanics, of the same system.\n \nOther results we have obtained indicate how to extend the classical notion of time to complex-valued notions of time, in classical mechanics.  Complex-valued means that complex numbers (including the square root of (-1)) are now to be considered \"fair game\" in the classical world. The insight on how that happens comes from quantum mechanics.  Interestingly, this is related to deep problems of geometry (over the complex numbers).\nWe have also obtained results on quantum systems that are subject to evolve within certain energy bounds.  We have constructed a sound mathematical theory for particles subject to such energy bounds.  Further, we have obtained strong numerical evidence that shows that, under such bounds, a quantum particle would split as it reaches the boundary of the allowed energy.  The center of the particle(s) follow the contour lines that represent the classical dynamics of the same system.  This is a new phenomenon we can predict, based on our theoretical resulst as well as on our numerical calculations.\nIn this way our results contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics, and also suggest intriguing lines of further research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alejandro Uribe",

The goal of these projects is to\r\nexpress physical quantities in terms of arithmetic geometry over\r\np-adic numbers and to use these expressions to prove integrality\r\ntheorems.  Another set of investigations deals with\r\nsupersymmetric deformations of quantum field theories.  This is\r\njoint work with M. Movshev and applies the theory of L-infinity\r\nand A-infinity algebras.  Another project is devoted to the\r\nanalysis of the relation between string theory and quantum field\r\ntheory. The principal investigator has argued that quantum field\r\ntheory can be formulated such that time and space do not appear\r\nas primary notions, and is planning to show that string theory\r\ncan be regarded as a quantum field theory in this sense.\r\n\r\nThese research projects are based on the application of methods\r\nof modern mathematics to physics, particularly making use of\r\narithmetic geometry and homological algebra to improve our\r\nunderstanding of quantum field theory and string theory.\r\nSophisticated mathematics originally developed for other purposes\r\nsuch as the study of Diophantine equations in number theory seems\r\nto bear directly on challenging issues in theoretical physics.\r\n",
