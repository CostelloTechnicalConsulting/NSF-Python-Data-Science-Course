         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is a new ultra low-cost carbon-oxygen battery that provides high energy density long-duration storage with unique fundamental properties needed to enable 100% renewable energy. This closed-loop stationary energy storage system will turn intermittent solar/wind power into on-demand power at lower cost than fossil fuel generation. Additionally, its high energy density (3x lighter and smaller than Lithium-ion batteries at system level) will enable longer range electric ships, trucks, etc. – a secondary target market – and a much more compact size for stationary storage than other batteries at the same energy capacity. The project will provide insight into the scale-up potential and design parameters of key battery components. Achieving 100% sustainable energy will have a wide range of societal impacts including minimizing environmental impact and improving human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project for the carbon-oxygen battery will thus focus on key technology development of the core components by modeling, building, and testing. This will involve assembling an array of small-scale prototype reactors to screen configurations and iterate on the design, followed by scale up to a larger megawatt-hour (MWh) scale reactors to integrate into a demo system.  The objectives of the Phase II project will focus on optimizing the reactor to achieve the key target metrics, including objectives to: 1) create and validate a multi-physics model of the optimized reactor, 2) design the optimized reactor, operating conditions, and materials, and 3) build and test several optimized reactors and show that the best design has the potential to fulfill the target metrics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nThis projects aims to describe the properties of so-called nematic phases in a variety of materials. The defining feature of nematic phases is orientational order in that the individual molecules are generally aligned along the same direction, yet their location is disordered. As a consequence, these materials flow like a normal fluid, yet they display solid like features when forces affect their orientational order. Such a hybrid nature is key to recent applications in flow control, material shape design and engineering, even actuation and soft robotics induced by light. More widely, a number of biological tissues exhibit the same properties in that oriented individual cells respond as a nematic phase, and such a response is involved in biological function. Theories to be developed in this project will describe the properties and response of those nematic materials that are comprised of complex molecular units, such a long organic molecules, stacks of individual disks in solution, or aggregates of living cells. The theory will pay special attention to defects in nematic phases. These are small regions in which the orientational order is broken, and that are known to determine the characteristic properties of the material. Such an observation lies at the center of recent efforts in the so-called defect engineering field, which seeks not to eliminate defects, but rather to produce them and to control their location and motion in order to produce material properties that would be unachievable in ideal materials without defects. A theoretical understanding of defects, their interactions, and their motion is central to enable further advances in defect engineering and the many applications that are currently being explored involving nematic phases.\r\n\r\nOn the educational side, the project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students, the latter through Summer internships and Honors Thesis projects. In addition, the PI has created and is teaching a new senior undergraduate course PHYS 4041, “Computational Methods in the Physical Sciences'' which is taken by students in Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering. The course involves semester long computational projects, many of which are drawn from examples of the research in this project. As the research proposed overlaps with Physics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Computational Science, there are many opportunities to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, including Honors projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nThis project addresses morphology, topological defects, and nonequilibrium transport in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals, both theoretically and through large scale computation. This material is studied in its nematic phase which displays long range orientational order with characteristic elastic response and defected textures. The research is motivated by recent developments in experimental diagnostics that give, for the first time, access to quantitative detail in the sub-micron range near topological singularities of the nematic director field, as well as related determinations of the material's elastic constants and rheology. These developments open the door to quantitative theories of liquid crystals with complex molecular architectures, extension to many realistic natural systems of the well-known small molecule and isotropic limits. This is necessary as nematic response is under active scrutiny in applications of active and biological matter that display nematic order.\r\n\r\nA self-consistent field theory is proposed to determine free energies of elastically anisotropic nematics. Phenomenological gradient expansions as in, for example, the Landau-de Gennes theory, lead to unbounded energies to the lowest order necessary to incorporate anisotropy. The functional space to the next order that is necessary to restore boundedness is too large to make the theory viable or useful. A computational implementation of a singular potential method has been introduced as an alternative. It has been validated with experimental determinations of singularity profiles in lyotropic chromonics, as well as with equilibrium morphologies of two phase tactoids. This method will be extended into a field theory that can accommodate two distinct features of chromonics: the microscopic units are charged aggregates, and of length that can change depending on distortion. Novel behavior is expected because the complexity of the interactions in lyotropics manifests itself in very small twist elastic constants, leading to novel modes of disclination interactions in three dimensions, to the appearance of configurations with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and even to propagating localized structures. The analysis will be fully three-dimensional and framed within a newly introduced topological invariant for uniaxial phases and an exact kinematic law for the motion of disclinations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical Abstract: The ability of a solid to conduct electricity and heat determines its application potential in new technologies such as microelectronics. Surprisingly, quantum physics predicts that the electricity- and heat- carrying capabilities of a solid at the nanometer scale do not reduce continuously with decreased cross-section. This quantum theory has been validated repeatedly in different experiments for both the electricity- and heat-carrying capabilities of electrons in different nanostructures. In comparison, there has been only one reported experimental observation of the predicted quantum behavior of the heat-carrying ability in a polycrystalline silicon nitride nanostructure. In response to a call for further experimental investigations of the quantum theory of lattice heat transport, this project is focused on experimental investigation of this quantum theory in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a unique measurement method. Success of this research is expected to both enhance the understanding of a essential pillar of condensed matter physics and provide education and outreach opportunities for broadening the participation in quantum and thermal science research and technology developments.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Free of two-level defects, SWCNTs are closest to an ideal one-dimensional (1D) quantum system among the nanostructures that have been experimentally realized. The goal of this work is to advance multiprobe measurements of the intrinsic thermal conductance of 1D nanostructures for accurate detection of the quantized phonon conductance that has been predicted for a SWCNT at a relatively high temperature up to about 10 K. This temperature range is much more conducive to producing unambiguous experimental evidence of quantized phonon conductance than the below-0.8 K temperature required for prior studies of silicon nitride nanobeams. If successful, the proposed measurements of SWCNTs will establish an experimental capability for detecting and controlling quantized phonon transport behaviors of low-dimensional systems. This capability is expected to advance the frontier of experimental research in a foundational area of condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education designed to advance understanding of materials that conduct electricity but contain electrons that apply strong forces on each other which led to new states of electronic matter. These quantum materials have novel properties. The PI will use model calculations for electrons in materials classes known as cuprates and iron-based superconductors, as well as others, to study several challenging problems directed towards a broader understanding of how these materials work. He will also work with a local science museum to prepare exhibits on superconductivity and magnetism for the public, and organize events designed to encourage young women students and researchers to consider a career in physics.\r\n\r\nSuperconductivity is the quantum state of many electrons in a metal that is characterized by the loss of all electrical resistance and consequently of all dissipation of energy. The PI will explore the interplay between the fundamental physics of superconductors and other phases of matter, including magnetic ones, which tend to form when superconductivity is suppressed. In addition, he will explore the effect of chemical impurities, where an atom in a crystal is replaced by a different element, as well as effects of other defects always present when crystals or films are grown. In particular, how these impurities determine the phases that are realized will be addressed.  For example, “islands” or droplets of a secondary phase may appear in the dominant phase of a superconductor. Thus, the PI will explore models of the effect of impurities and other real-life defects on the properties of these superconducting materials. The PI will focus especially on the theory of how to interpret results from scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. This technique reveals atomic-resolution images of the quantum states of a material by applying a voltage to a tiny sharp metal tip as it is scanned over the material's surface - effectively taking an atomic-scale “photograph” of the quantum state. Information obtained from theoretical calculations and the analysis of data from these experiments may provide key insights into the interplay of superconductivity and other quantum states including magnetism and a novel “electronic nematic” state of electrons that is a quantum mechanical analog of states that make liquid crystal displays possible.  One consequence of these investigations may be a deeper insight into the nature of high temperature superconductivity and how it can be further optimized, which could have technological implications.  Understanding the properties of these quantum materials and the influence of disorder may also lead to novel properties that can be utilized in new devices and technologies, such as sensors with unusual sensitivity operating near boundaries among competing phases in highly correlated metals.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to address long-standing fundamental problems involving the interplay of quenched disorder and various types of competing emergent order in correlated electron systems. The materials to be investigated include cuprate and iron-based superconductors, as well as other quantum materials displaying competing orders. The PI will study properties of electronic systems through a careful analysis of the behavior of simplified models of interacting electrons on the lattice, informed in some cases by density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations with appropriate inclusion of correlations. There are three main projects:\r\n\r\n1.  Effects of disorder on overdoped cuprates. The PI will perform a series of investigations on the cuprate materials that can be doped well past optimal doping, to illustrate the unexpected effects of scattering from out-of-plane dopants, and test the materials-specific theory of impurity scattering developed using Wannier function-derived scattering potentials from DFT. The PI and his group will develop materials-specific impurity potentials to understand normal- and superconducting-state transport where forward scattering from impurities can be important, in particular the angle-dependent elastic mean free path observed in resistivity measurements, as well as Terahertz conductivity.    Some of this work will be done in collaboration with a group at Simon Fraser University.  \r\n  Even in the overdoped cuprates, there  is a substantial discrepancy between the resistive Tc and the T where the gap closes.  The team will try to calculate how much of the gap filling phenomenon is due to disorder-induced inhomogeneity near the transition, that is, when the system breaks up into small islands of good superconductor that are weakly proximity coupled.  These phenomenological studies will be supplemented by microscopic studies of spin fluctuation theory, where the doping dependence of the intrinsic pairing interaction is Hubbard-type and modified by disorder, to study the disappearance of Tc on the overdoped side.\r\n\r\n2. STM of charge and pair density waves. Much of the physical information available on competing order and inhomogeneity arises from scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy on high quality surfaces; yet the theory to interpret such data is available only in very primitive form. The PI will use microscopic Wannier functions from ab initio calculations to construct local Green's functions in both superconducting and metallic states to compare with experiments on charge and pair density waves, calculating the local density of states above the sample surface where measurements are actually performed.  In particular, the PI will develop the theory of scanning Josephson spectroscopy to calculate the local critical current using the Wannier function continuum representation, in both the coherent and diffusive regimes to compare with Josephson STM experiments currently being performed.  Understanding the properties of correlated electron systems and the influence of disorder may lead to novel materials properties that can be utilized in new devices and technologies, obtaining unusual sensitivity by operating near transitions between competing phases that occur in highly correlated electron systems.\r\n\r\n3.  Thermal transport and penetration depth in uranium ditelluride with elastic scattering. The spin-triplet heavy fermion superconductor uranium ditelluride is still quite mysterious and the structure of the superconducting gaps are unknown.  Thermal conductivity experiments suggest point nodes, while penetration depth experiments imply that the nodes may be distributed away from high symmetry points.  The PI will develop the theory of both experimental probes for triplet states to settle these issues, including nonunitary ones proposed to explain Kerr effect and muon spin resonance indications of time reversal symmetry breaking.   He will further investigate the role of disorder in producing these signals.  \r\n\r\nThis award also supports outreach activities including: designing a new exhibit on electrical conduction and superconductivity for the recently opened Cade Museum for Innovation, organizing U. Florida Activities in support of United Nations Women and Girls in Science Day, and developing and delivering public lectures. Software developed for the calculation of spin fluctuation pairing, and a database for Wannier functions in unconventional superconductors, will be made available through the PI's website and GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel, surgically implanted device for treating female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Nearly 50% of women in the U.S. will suffer from stress urinary incontinence with age resulting in over 40 million suffering women by 2050. No pharmacological solutions currently exist and mesh-based midurethral slings (MUS) are the mainstay surgical option, even though they are associated with various long-term complications, challenges, and risks. Furthermore, all SUI repair products on the market are polypropylene mesh-based with no alternatives available. This project aims to address this gap in options with a mesh-free, sling-free, outpatient transvaginal repair device for female urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and validate a novel, transvaginal surgical procedural technology for treating stress urinary incontinence. This project progresses findings from the SBIR Phase I project which demonstrated functional proof-of-concept biomechanical feasibility. This Phase II project aims to further the surgical procedure and system in a manner suitable for human use. The scope of technical activities includes design optimization, mechanical testing and validation, surgical procedure validation, biocompatibility testing, and histological characterization in a series of benchtop, cadaveric, and animal studies. The scope of the activities will be conducted in accordance with practices needed to demonstrate chronic implanted safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models in order to gain eventual U.S. regulatory approval.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the first fully implantable, subcutaneous system for treating 200,000 infants born with congenital conditions causing impaired growth of the skull or mandible. These abnormalities affect basic functions including breathing, hearing, speech, visual function, neurologic development, and mastication. Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) is a widely recognized clinical treatment for craniofacial abnormalities that applies controlled mechanical forces to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects by leveraging the natural ability of the body to regenerate bone. Current semi-externalized mechanical design systems restore functional discrepancies but result in issues with patient comfort and adverse events that rely on caregivers to follow precise treatment protocols that hinder widespread adoption. This project aims to develop the first fully subcutaneous, automated DO system for the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) skeleton. Applications include surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder in the adult population, representing potential markets exceeding $10 billion.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a novel, fully implantable craniofacial distraction system comprised of an implantable, magnetically driven mechanism and an external controller driver. The system aims to significantly improve upon existing distraction osteogenesis surgical designs by removing an external component that protrudes through the patient’s skin using a novel implantable magnetic driver design. The novel design enables manual mechanical device adjustment capable of providing the necessary distraction forces in a safe and reliable manner, while eliminating the principal path of complications and treatment noncompliance. The proposed benefits would reduce the risks of infection, device dislodgement, analgesic use, patient stigma, required manual operation, and treatment noncompliance. This project aims to reduce the key critical remaining engineering design risks including system usability issues prior to clinical use and manufacturability. Upon completion of the project, the prototypes will undergo in vivo testing in preclinical models prior to human use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is in the development of a visual unilateral neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation tool for stroke patients.  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability, including the cost of healthcare services, medicines and missed days of work. Stroke related costs in the United States are around $50 billion every year. Unilateral spatial neglect (neglect) is a disabling neurocognitive impairment for stroke patients occurring in 28.60% of the stroke population.  Moreover, neglect is a strong predictor of disability, and stroke patients with neglect have longer hospital stays and receive more direct treatment time from physical and occupational therapists than individuals without neglect, culminating in significantly higher healthcare costs.  However, there is currently no commercial product targeting neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation. Current clinical gold standard neglect detection methods are affected by compensatory strategies and are not sensitive to changes in the severity of neglect; and rehabilitation techniques are not effective in reducing disability associated with neglect.  This project, through a multidisciplinary team, will address these issues while developing the proposed neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation tool that incorporates stimulation to draw attention to the affected side of the body and environment based on the automatic detection of neglect through neurophysiology measured through electroencephalography, thereby stimulating neural networks responsible for spatial attention and perceptual processing for stroke patients. Stimulation during everyday activities with high levels of repetition is needed to promote implicit learning that supports generalization of learning and independence.  Current detection and rehabilitation methods lack the necessary precision, salience, and repetition to promote this type of learning. Due to limitations associated with these methods, there is no gold assessment for neglect or standard of care for rehabilitation of neglect in routine clinical practice. The proposed project offers a potential solution to these problems, incorporating best practices from rehabilitation intervention research and state-of-the-art technologies that will be cost-effective to be implemented in rehabilitation clinics. The proposed technology incorporates objective and reliable quantification of neglect severity and tailored sensory stimulation that is: (i) technology-driven (accurate, reliable, repetitive, cost-effective); (ii) multimodal: visual, auditory, haptic stimulation (optimizes perceptual processing); (iii) individualized to the available field of vision; and (iv) simultaneous with ``real-world'' activities of daily living .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) project provides a high-quality, publicly available data resource for the empirical study of international conflict. The data include all international interactions, by any state in any location, short of war but where the state has intentionally involved or invoked the military by way of threat, show, or use of force against another state. This project, MID6, will update coverage through 2024 and standardize data collection methods for future updates. It will also create MID-Live for the early release of candidate data and for near real-time incident detection. MID6 is critical for all organizations and individuals concerned with national security in general, and militarized interactions between states in particular. It will provide interested parties with the opportunity to develop an analytical understanding of when national security incidents are likely to escalate to military force or are likely to be managed short of this point. It will provide information on evolving patterns of conflict and competition between nation-states, as well as opportunities for cooperation. In essence, MID6 will advance our understanding of the conditions under which conflict, cooperation, and competition are more likely to occur. This project will also bring societal benefits through a focus on providing research experience for students from historically excluded and minoritized backgrounds, as well as cadets from the U.S. Air Force Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data are a primary resource for the study of international conflict and are regularly used in the field of international relations. The current data have coverage from 1816 to 2014. This effort, MID6, will update coverage through 2024, providing an additional ten years of data on militarized interstate incidents and disputes involving any country in any location. It will incorporate research with new tools and technological innovations, specifically in the areas of natural language processing, promote graduate student training, and provide extensive research experience for undergraduates including cadets and members of historically excluded and minoritized populations. It will standardize data collection procedures for ongoing updates beyond 2024 and will provide the highest levels of transparency and accessibility in the data collection process. This project will also create MID-Live for the early release of candidate data and for near real-time incident detection. Through official project channels, for example social media accounts and the MID website hosted by the Correlates of War project, it will identify and publicize MID incidents as they occur. By releasing data faster, MID-Live will improve input data to forecasting models and conflict monitoring systems, as well as provide analysts objective data on conflicts as they occur. Overall, the expansion of the MID data through 2024 and the new innovations ensure that researchers and analysts have the data they need to study and understand international conflict.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance clinical methods that address the extensive physiological variation that is age- and race-dependent. Well-publicized over the last few decades is the lack of healthcare solutions for diseases in preemie babies, who are born to mothers with significant socioeconomic inequalities. Case in point, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and often fatal gastrointestinal, or gut, emergency in premature infants that disproportionately affects African American babies. The disease has not only confounded doctors and nurses for 200 years, but also these neonatal emergencies are also frightening to almost all preemie care providers due to its high mortality rate.  Its healthcare in the US requires $3 billion annually due to repeated x-ray testing, surgery, longer hospital stays, and long-term complications of its survivors. An early and accurate diagnostic test for NEC would be a disruptive paradigm shift in preemie intensive care: it would enable medical intervention to be more effective, reduce risk of disease progression, decrease medical care expenses by hundreds of millions annually, and lower mortality.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop requisite reagents for a diagnostic test that will enable detection of infant proteins that play a role in gut health.  Absolute quantitation is a prerequisite for data interpretation and validation between experiments, laboratories, and testing platforms. Research objectives are directed toward critical technical hurdles: (1) determination of optimal reference standard to quantitate host biomolecules in clinical settings and (2) understanding the usage limitations of these reference standards in the background of high variation in the human population. Native and recombinant candidates will be compared and analyzed with various methods.  Anticipated results are reference standards that are age-specific for diagnostic use in the most fragile and smallest patients and that are acceptable to regulatory stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel device which reduces injury to patients by emergency personnel when using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) manual resuscitator. BVMs are used in pre-hospital and hospital settings by emergency medical personnel on a daily basis to deliver air to critically ill patients. Their basic design has been in place for over 60 years and are often misused resulting in damage, complications, or occasionally fatal lung injury. This project will complete development of a novel BVM that precisely controls the volumes and pressures delivered, and aims to redefine the stagnant BVM market which is projected to surpass $750M annually by 2025.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, adjustable, universal bag-valve-mask resuscitator enabling emergency providers to deliver air volumes and pressures customized to patient body size. Current devices are commonly misused, even by highly trained medical personnel, resulting in hyperventilation, barotrauma, and occasional death. The project will complete remaining design and testing tasks, and a human factors proof of concept study to demonstrate users are able to quickly and properly utilize the device with minimal instruction will be performed. The second objective will address manufacturability and testing requirements within standards for US approval. Finally, the third objective is to establish the assembly processes and initial quality control testing to ensure consistent manufacturing at scale and in a cost effective and quality consistent manner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Barrier-island communities face flooding due to rising sea levels and stronger storms, and typical adaptations (protect, accommodate, retreat) may not keep up with increasing risks. Communities are now considering extreme adaptations, such as allowing an island section to ‘return to nature’ by removing roadways and other infrastructure. But these extreme adaptations transform the natural processes of and the community’s relationship with barriers. The effects on flood risks at nearby communities are not well understood, and it is not clear whether communities will ‘welcome the water’ or reject it as opposing their sense of place. This Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project explores participatory transformation of barriers. Stakeholders will provide insights on place meanings across the barrier island and how floods affect these places and their connections to the community. The project also quantifies how flooding at a natural island section may change the hazard at neighboring communities, and whether these locations can be selected to minimize the risks while maximizing community attachments. These activities provide a framework for participatory transformation, as well as advance technologies for flood risk modeling that can be expanded to improve disaster resilience for communities along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts. This research also supports an immersive experience for students to collaborate across engineering and social-science disciplines to tackle the challenges of climate change.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project advances understanding of how local erosion events contribute to floods at neighboring communities; how these floods can be managed by allowing barrier sections to return to nature; and how such a transformation, when informed and deliberated by community stakeholders, may affect community place meanings. The research will be organized on the following objectives: (O1) identify ‘acceptable’ locations for extreme adaptation of barrier systems; (O2) quantify reductions in flood risk from extreme adaptations at ‘acceptable’ and other locations; and (O3) assess changes in stakeholders’ perceptions about extreme adaptation techniques for barrier islands. Via high-resolution modeling of flooding subject to possible barrier configurations and future climate scenarios, this project quantifies the scales of flooding at neighboring communities. And via science co-production, this project investigates how the community’s attachment to the barrier island may be increased if stakeholders take an active role in the transformation. This project uses transformative research approaches and engagement to facilitate new approaches to community-led management and adaptation of barriers, enable improved efforts to plan for the consequences of landform changes and development, and advance the integration of the coastal science, engineering, and adaptation disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Damaging thunderstorm-wind events in the US outnumber those of tornadoes by an order of magnitude, with greater cumulative losses. Most notably, the August 2020 derecho event in the Midwest US was the costliest thunderstorm event in US history at over $13Billion in losses. Critical questions regarding the mechanisms for such extreme wind generation remain unanswered, partly because, relative to tornadoes, thunderstorm winds have been understudied both by meteorologists and engineers. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will examine how characteristics of thunderstorm winds, including design-level peak wind speeds, relate to the different generating mechanisms of such winds. The project will also investigate spatial variabilities and temporal intermittencies associated with these mechanisms, which will contribute to the fundamental understanding of thunderstorm-wind generation and the variability observed in the field. The underlying focus of the project on hazardous thunderstorms will ultimately lead to better forecasts and warnings of thunderstorm-wind events, and to integration of the findings into building codes and standards. In addition, the project will train a new generation of interdisciplinary engineers and scientists who appreciate both the basic scientific problem, and the engineering solutions.\r\n\r\nConceptual wind-damage models, especially for engineering, have focused on the “downburst” as being responsible for all extreme winds near the surface. However, there are other mechanisms for thunderstorm wind generation including the rear-inflow jet (RIJ) and mesovortices, which may be responsible for a significant proportion of damage from thunderstorms. RIJ-induced winds are suspected in the August 2020 derecho based on early results from numerical simulations.  This project will examine alternative forcing mechanisms by combining existing observational data from the August 2020 derecho and other high-impact events, with post-event damage surveys, and to-be-developed high-resolution numerical simulations of convective-storm events. Three major research tasks will tease out the different mechanisms: (1) Numerical simulations of specific events, with resolution sufficient for determination of the wind-generation mechanism and associated forcings and reduced-complexity dynamical modeling to relate the wind forcings to the detailed characteristics of the thunderstorm winds. (2) Wind engineering analysis, which will match/compare the modeling results of specific events to existing thunderstorm wind data and post-event damage data as well as an analysis of the data generated from the higher resolution numerical models. This analysis will include four-dimensional assessment of engineering-relevant characteristics such as peak wind speed, wind speed profiles, and comparisons to existing engineering models of thunderstorm winds. (3) Climatological analysis of thunderstorm winds in the US, with specific interest in sub-classifying these winds by their generation mechanism (RIJ, downburst, mesovortex). Each mechanism will be assessed for their importance in wind loading of structures through the engineering characteristics in (2). This will connect the results from (1) and (2).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "A seismic event often involves multiple hazards (e.g., ground shaking, landslide, and liquefaction) and impacts (e.g., building and infrastructure damage). Understanding the locations and extents of such hazards and impacts in high resolution immediately after an event is critical for facilitating real-time responses, such as timely evacuation, search and rescue, and effective allocations of limited resources.  Researchers have been investigating using satellite imageries to extract hazard and impact information for wide affected areas; however, the co-occurrence and co-location of hazards and impacts result in mixed signals in satellite imagery, making it very challenging to directly categorize and estimate each hazard and associated impacts. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project aims to develop a novel system to provide rapid, scalable, and joint assessments of cascading seismic hazards and impacts by leveraging the causal dependencies among them. It will enhance the accuracy, resolution, and timeliness of existing rapid disaster information systems by integrating satellite images with existing geospatial hazard models from The US Geological Survey and building fragility functions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s HAZUS tool. The revealed regional causal mechanisms aims to enable improved seismic risk analysis as well as the study of other natural disasters involving cascading impacts. This will improve overall community resilience to future natural disasters.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a causality-informed variational Bayesian network modeling framework to adaptively provide regional-scale seismic multi-hazard and impact occurrence estimates in near-real-time, by fusing information from satellite images with prior geophysical knowledge and building fragility functions through a deep causal Bayesian network. First, a novel paradigm will be established to model complex and implicit causal dependencies among cascading seismic multi-hazards and impacts as a flow-based causal Bayesian network to integrate information from prior hazards and impact models with mixed-signal satellite imagery. Further, an online variational Bayesian inference framework will be developed to jointly infer and update, in a scalable and efficient manner, the estimations of seismic multi-hazards and impacts, with or without partially observed ground truth. Third, local geospatial hazards model and building fragility functions will be updated through a novel uncertainty-aware prior model updating scheme using the event-specific patterns learned from the causal Bayesian network. The quantitative causal mechanisms of cascading seismic hazards and building damage, revealed by the causal Bayesian network, will be characterized in multiple earthquake events, to render an in-depth understanding of event-specific seismic hazards and damage patterns for improving regional resilience to future disaster events. The framework will be demonstrated on seven moderate-to-large global earthquake events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In reinforced concrete buildings, cast-in-place floor slabs, or “diaphragms”, must resist both gravity loads, the weight of the structure and building contents, and horizontal loads, caused by wind or the inertia of the floors during earthquakes. For the building to function, these floor diaphragms also must contain openings for stairs, elevators, and mechanical systems. Although the presence of these openings is accounted for when designing the structure for gravity loads, there is little research or understanding of how they affect the building’s behavior during earthquake loading. The potential consequences of this lack of understanding were recently demonstrated during earthquake simulator tests on a five-story reinforced concrete building. Unexpected diaphragm damage during testing indicates that openings adjacent to walls and columns contribute to collapse risk and could preclude or delay the return of a building’s functionality after a seismic event. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings and develop tools for their design and for probabilistically quantifying their expected performance during an earthquake. The research will be complemented by an online class curriculum focusing on accurate simulation approaches and their validation, for both students and practitioners, as part of the recently established earthquake engineering certificate program and outreach to engage underrepresented minority and first-generation college students in research.\r\n\r\nThis award will focus on advancing science-based tools and technologies, through simulation-driven experimental testing and nonlinear finite element analysis of prototype buildings under multiple hazard intensities, for the collapse-resistant and recovery-based earthquake engineering of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings. This research will investigate (1) accurate load paths, including fanned collection patterns from regions of low stress to struts, which form the primary load path; (2) the impact of openings and establishing protected zones to mitigate damage that could lead to partial collapse; and (3) damage states and fragility curves that quantify diaphragm performance for inclusion in functional recovery methodologies. Several fundamental research questions will be answered, including (1) what is the inertial load path through the diaphragm, and how are these load paths affected by openings; (2) how does the slab thickness, reinforcement, and the presence of openings affect the capacity of diaphragm elements subjected to complex in-plane stresses; (3) how does the presence of openings modify the effective stiffness of diaphragms, and what is the effect on engineering demand parameters; (4) what is the relationship between engineering demand parameters, ground motion intensity measures, and diaphragm damage; and (5) how does diaphragm damage around openings affect safety, story access, and tenet functionality. Equally important, this project will form the foundation for additional research to fully investigate the lateral force resisting system, including slab-wall and slab-column connections, using pseudo-dynamic and earthquake simulator testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Wildfires can have detrimental effects on the safety, economy, and well-being of affected communities with the risk borne disproportionately by disadvantaged communities. A critical factor that can prevent wildfires from turning into a human disaster is “access,” which refers to the ease of reaching shelters and is the product of both mobility and location of shelters. Despite its crucial importance, the state-of-the-art solutions and practices currently lack a systematic framework that determines access during wildfire events while incorporating equity considerations. The overarching goal of this Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project is to incorporate equity into wildfire preparedness strategies and minimize the equity of access gap to resources between disadvantaged and advantaged communities. The adverse effects of wildfires can be mitigated if a community understands its existing vulnerabilities and adapts strategic preparedness plans before a disaster to build resilience. Wildfire preparedness strategies, however, must be formulated and implemented through the lens of equity and justice. For example, for residents who do not have access to transportation, a simple task like locating and driving to an American Red Cross shelter is not feasible.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project develops a science-informed community-based solution for disadvantaged communities to augment equity discrepancies and community resilience to the devasting impacts of the ongoing challenge for residents of wildfire-prone areas. It fulfills three objectives: (i) it quantifies disparities in shelter access between disadvantaged and advantaged communities, (ii) it optimizes access-related equity through short- and long-term wildfire preparedness strategies, and (iii) it develops a science-based community-centered interactive strategic planning platform for public officials and community members. This is exercised in close collaboration with our community partners in Lake County, California, where 60% of the land has burned between 2015 and 2020, possesses key characteristics of an at-risk community, and is home to a significant population of underserved residents, including indigenous people. The potential benefit to society from the researched project is improving the resilience of disadvantaged communities and equipping the community, emergency management, and emergency responders with the knowledge and science-based tools required to make informed decisions and decrease the escapable repercussions on disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "To promote community resilience and equity, this Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project examines a series of place-based, human-centered networks, leveraging micromobility (lightweight vehicles such as bicycles or scooters), community social ties, and resilience hubs, to better meet those impacted by a disaster after the event. In particular, the project investigates the potential role of social networks and micromobility in enhancing the planning and operation of resilience hubs, an emerging infrastructural concept that has the potential to support more equitable disaster response and recovery efforts. The project investigates opportunities and challenges regarding enhancing resilience in two study locations: a metropolitan coastal city and an inland suburban community where the results can inform more equitable transportation operational strategies and preparedness measures for other highly vulnerable regions of the United States. The results of this research can extend the state of knowledge about how micromobility resilience hubs can support social network connectivity, increase community cohesion and capacity, and enhance community and national resilience. Communities and people are at the center of the research, learning from stakeholder expertise and experiences to adapt the resilience hub concept to meet the needs of future resilient cities.\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to understand how micromobility infrastructure and community social networks can be effectively leveraged in disaster response. Using human-centered data and mixed-method analyses, this Disaster Resilience Research Grant project combines social network analysis, qualitative thematic analysis, discrete choice modeling, and agent-based simulations, to model a cohesive network for disaster-prone communities addressing the vulnerabilities of individuals and the community. The objectives of this project are to 1) understand the functions, usage, and applicability of micromobility in different disaster scenarios; 2) understand how micromobility systems and local social networks can be integrated to better support communities in both every day and disaster scenarios; and 3) validate the applicability of micromobility resilience hubs as connection points for micromobility and social networks in a range of communities and disaster types via the empirical analysis and synthesis of findings from focus groups, surveys, interviews, simulations, and on-the-ground field tests co-designed with community partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Immediately after a major hazard event (e.g., wildfire, earthquake, flood), a prompt assessment of the geographic distribution and severity of infrastructure damage is vital to the success of the emergency response and early recovery planning. This situational awareness is an important part of the decision-making processes that are implemented by facility owners, users, emergency responders and local and state officials. Conversely, a general lack of knowledge about the impacted state of the built environment can lead to a disorganized public response and slower recovery. While a comprehensive assessment of the extent and distribution of infrastructure damage can be obtained from in-person inspections conducted by building professionals, depending on the scale of the event, this can be a lengthy, resource intensive process. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will address this challenge by utilizing principles from artificial intelligence (AI) to develop near real-time infrastructure damage prediction models that can process and utilize different types of data and information (e.g., images, text, tabular data). By advancing our ability to effectively integrate disparate information sources, this project aims to transform the way that physical damage to infrastructure is estimated in the aftermath of a major disaster event, thereby enhancing the emergency response and recovery planning phases that follow. The research will provide training for doctoral and masters students and an opportunity to teach undergraduates from different backgrounds how science and engineering coupled with AI technologies can be used to improve community response to extreme events.\r\n\r\nFundamental concepts and methodological advancements in multimodal learning will be used to transform and enhance infrastructure damage prediction models for use in the immediate post-event environment. The state-of-the-art in image-based damage assessment will be advanced along two dimensions: (1) developing Vision Transformer-based methods and (2) establishing a self-supervised learning methodology for training the models using large collections of unlabeled data. A new knowledge base will be established around the broad area of multimodal data fusion for infrastructure damage prediction models. Specific questions regarding unified representation, translation across and alignment between modalities and data fusion will be answered. A new type of hazard-agnostic infrastructure damage prediction model will also emerge from this research. Such a model will have the ability to receive an integrated representation of one or more types of input modalities (i.e., image, text, and engineering/tabular data) and produce, as output, an infrastructure damage level that is agnostic to the type of causal event (e.g., earthquake or hurricane). Using a comprehensive data set from multiple natural hazard events (hurricane and earthquake), the project will include experiments to shed new light on the ability of both hazard-specific and hazard-agnostic multimodal models to enhance early-stage infrastructure damage assessments for increased situational awareness and enhanced resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Geoscience as a profession is at a crossroads with respect to attracting individuals from diverse populations and training future geoscientists. Western Oregon University (WOU) will develop a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem, which is a collaborative partnership between a four-year public university, natural resource focused government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and regional geoscience employers. The goal of the partnership is to cultivate Earth science literacy and motivate novel solutions to local environmental issues, while connecting diverse student populations to the geoscience discipline with altruistic motivations for pursuing future careers as professionals. The project will engage and invigorate a new generation of geoscience professionals, particularly those who have been structurally excluded in the sciences. Existing elements of WOU’s Earth and Environmental Science program will be strengthened with the intentional cultivation of an enhanced Geo-STEM learning ecosystem that provides professional mentorship and career-outreach experiences, designed to increase awareness of opportunities for professional outcomes in early career undergraduates who otherwise lack access. \r\n\r\nThe overarching project goal is to strengthen a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem and engage more young people in geosciences at the undergraduate level. The project will focus on mentored geoscience education through development of community water resource partnerships. Given that water resources and river restoration are iconic scientific themes in the Pacific Northwest, the WOU GEOPAths project team has adapted fundamental concepts of floodplain connectivity to the Geo-STEM learning ecosystem model, with the analogous intent of increasing connections between early career undergraduates to the geoscience profession. Specific objectives include: (1) increasing enrollment, diversity, and retention in the geosciences; (2) strengthening the statewide Geo-STEM learning ecosystem by fortifying connections to the professional community; and (3) testing novel approaches to recruitment of diverse populations in the geoscience profession. Extra-curricular experiences and training in the geosciences with a focus on service-learning and workforce training will lead to increased probabilities for student engagement, academic success, and positive career outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The global population has skyrocketed from approximately one billion in 1800 to over eight billion in 2024, driving increased demand for vital and interrelated resources like energy, food, and water. Sustainable approaches are required to meet the escalating energy demand, including resource conservation, energy storage enhancements, and global energy resource management. Addressing the research challenges associated with providing clean energy for the world is a multidisciplinary problem that requires scientists and engineers from diverse fields to collaborate closely. However, the current academic research on sustainable energy is primarily concentrated within traditional academic disciplines. Consequently, academic programs may fail to train graduate students who will enter the energy sector workforce with the essential communication skills and technical expertise to confront these profoundly interdisciplinary challenges. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Boston University (BU) will create an interdisciplinary community of students trained to work collaboratively on sustainable energy research and development. The ENERGIZE project anticipates training 100-125 Ph.D. and master’s students, including 20 funded trainees from a diverse range of disciplines across the university. Trainees will come primarily, but not exclusively, from Ph.D. programs.\r\n\r\nThe technical focus of the ENERGIZE NRT spans research in photochemical conversion, electrochemical conversion, electrochemical storage, and photochemical storage while concurrently providing foundational training for students in physical and computational experimentation and data science. The program has five integrated components: (i) evidence-based experiential learning and interdisciplinary collaborations, (ii) building communications and leadership skills, (iii) career development, (iv) interdisciplinary mentoring, and (v) rigorous program assessment to track learning outcomes. Trainees will develop depth in a particular area of study and breadth across complementary areas of energy conversion, energy storage, sustainability, and data science through coursework, workshops, an internship-based practicum, and mentored laboratory research projects. They will engage in formal activities devoted to professional development, career planning, and skills acquisition through bootcamps, tailored workshops, and leadership opportunities within the NRT community. The project outcomes will include a model for educating scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary research, a research community with technical depth and breadth and a broad understanding of the social impact of sustainable energy and their own research, and educational materials and best practices on research education and professional development.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to build a cross-region innovative research group focused on equitable educational innovations to support historically excluded middle and high school youth–Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC), female-identifying youth, and youth in Title I schools or rural underserved districts–to develop embodied pathways to participation in geosciences communities. The key project activity will be the creation of a practitioner research group composed of community stakeholders, teachers, geoscience faculty, and educational community partners. This group will collaborate to develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation pathways for supporting historically excluded youth in geoscience communities of practice through hands-on fieldwork experiences and digital reflections. The stakeholders will form goals, identify success measures, and work to expand their program’s goals through developing a shared understanding around what equitable participation trajectories look like across similar domains.\r\n\r\nThe effects of underserved youth being excluded from the geosciences is readily reflected in the field however, less is known about the experiences of these youth in such trajectories and how geosciences educational stakeholders could redesign pathways to better serve the students. This project will use methods of community design research to 1) develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation in geoscience fieldwork; 2) develop shared best practices for facilitating more equitable participation in geosciences fieldwork and disciplinary conversations; and 3) support network partners in redesigning programs to set and meet expansive goals in this regard. Over the course of the project, the PI team will build a network of geosciences instructors and practitioners and work on iterative cycles of expanding their programmatic goals in alignment with the five key areas for the following outcomes: 1) Grounded fun; 2) STEM capital; 3) STEM trajectories; 4) STEM identity work; and 5) Agency.\r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to serve the national interest by producing more qualified technicians to meet workforce demands in cybersecurity. Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge in business, industry, and government. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect both existing and emerging technologies. This project will prepare students for cybersecurity technician positions by engaging with employers to strengthen the technical experience that students gain during their courses. The project will also focus on increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation of students from underrepresented groups and will thereby improve the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\nBased at Cypress College, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), this project will build on a previous NSF-funded project, called \"PACE: Pathway to Advance Cybersecurity Education\" (NSF Award DUE-1902519), which developed a pathway from high school (as early as 9th grade) with multiple educational and employment exit points. The new project, known as \"ACE IDEAS: Advanced Cybersecurity Education for Industry-driven, Diversity-minded, Early Aged Students,\" has two main goals: (1) update and augment the PACE cybersecurity courses to include project-based learning, internships, soft skills, and focused preparation for industry certification exams and (2) build program enrollment, persistence, and completion through activities with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups. In particular, the investigators will work closely with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) to align the curriculum with the needs of employers, develop internships, and integrate project-based learning. Other activities will include developing an ePortfolio system for students, developing an industry mentorship program for students, engaging high school students in CyberPatriot and other competitions, and offering workshops on inclusive practices to high school teachers and counselors and college faculty. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to investigate the behavior of quantum systems with many particles, such as electrons in a crystalline solid.  The large number of electrons and their inherent quantum mechanical nature can act in concert leading to new states of matter.  Among these are superconductors, which can conduct electricity with zero resistance, and the quantum Hall states, in which a strong magnetic field causes electrons confined to two dimensions to execute tight circular orbits, thereby forcing net electrical current flow to thei edges of the system.  The goal of the PI’s work is to combine tools from theoretical condensed matter and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these states of quantum matter. \r\n\r\nIn the last few years, quantum computing has motivated significant progress in condensed matter theory.  Quantum computing deals with systems that contain many quantum bits, providing a new perspective on the physics of systems of many quantum mechanical particles that is complementary to the traditional one.  The PI will combine new quantum computing inspired methods with standard condensed matter techniques to gain a better understanding of the landscape of condensed matter phases.  One particular benefit of this program is that some of the exotic condensed matter phases studied by the PI may in turn have applications to the design of new quantum computing platforms.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD.  The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics, and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to classify topological quantum phases of matter, including those that are out of equilibrium and those protected by additional symmetries.  The PI will combine ideas from condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these quantum many-body systems.  Specifically, the PI will connect the topological features of quantum field theories, such as topological terms in continuum effective actions, to topological invariants that can in principle be directly extracted from a lattice Hamiltonian, such as braiding statistics of anyon or defect excitations.  Because a lattice quantum many-body system is essentially a many-qubit system, it is natural that ideas from quantum information theory will naturally be involved in this work.  One quantum information idea is that of a non-trivial quantum cellular automaton, which is a generalization of a shallow-depth circuit of local unitaries.  The PI will explore the utility of using such quantum cellular automatons to disentangle exotic, “beyond-cohomology,” symmetry protected topological phases of matter.\r\n\r\nAn additional tool that the PI plans to use is that of the conformal bootstrap.  This is a numerical technique that constrains the possible conformal field theories that can exist, by putting bounds on their spectra of dimensions of local operators.  Building on preliminary work, the PI's team will research how to constrain the conformal field theories that can exist at the boundaries of topological phases, by incorporating the corresponding 't Hooft anomalies into the conformal bootstrap.  More generally, the aim of the PI will be to determine how to incorporate information about the non-local operators that appear in topological field-theories into the conformal bootstrap.  Furthermore, the PI will also explore topological effects in non-equilibrium settings, such as the recently introduced measurement-induced entanglement transition.  Preliminary work by the PI's team has uncovered, for a certain simple instance of this transition, a dual statistical-mechanics model which exhibits a topological phase transition.  The PI plans to explore more general versions of this duality.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD.  The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards (RIA) provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award will help to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Johnson C. Smith University aims to investigate green technology and its application to inhibit bacterial growth. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the phytochemical constituents found within citrus fruits have natural antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The project is designed to engage undergraduate students in fundamental research, as well as strengthen the research-based pedagogical approaches of the Principal Investigator. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the fundamental plasmonic, Green Nanotechnology (e.g., method/route) response of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) interacting with Streptococcus pneumoniae, is critical in combating the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance. The aims of the proposed study are threefold: (i) Determine the antibiotic influence of plant extraction on the proliferation of various S. pneumoniae isolates, (ii) Examine the effect of Green synthesized AgNPs on planktonic growth of S. pneumoniae, and (iii) Determine the cytotoxicity of green synthesized, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel synthesized Ag Nanoparticles on noncancerous, upper respiratory cell lines. In this study, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel extracts are used as an eco-friendly, reducing and stabilizing agent. The synthesized AgNPs characterization involves using Ultra-violet (UV)-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy, (FTIR), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Zeta Potential, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). While this research addresses alternative approaches to combat bacterial growth against antimicrobial resistant bacteria in a more biological, economical, and eco-friendly manner, the results have the potential to shed light on new knowledge and treatment(s) for medical implants (e.g. catheters, joint prostheses, and pacemakers) and dental implants/orthodontic devices as well as maintenance of pipes/plumbing systems (e.g. biofouling), ship hulls and underwater structures, food processing equipment, and water distribution systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There continues to be increasing demand for more comprehensive assessments of the impacts of STEM education programs, policies, and practices. One stumbling block to such research is the need for large sample sizes for studies to be able to make the intended claims. This research develops, and tests new estimation procedures for cross-classified structural equation models for the statistical analysis of small to moderate sample size studies of teaching and learning in mathematics. These new tools reduce the burden of large sample sizes. The team will develop new shareable software tools (in an open-source software application) and deliver training opportunities to researchers. Further, these estimation models and research tools will have broad impact as they are usable for similar study designs in all STEM content learning settings.\r\n\r\nThis research bridges the gap between current research methods and the scale with which most STEM education studies are conducted. The team will develop new estimation methods for small to moderate sample cross-classified structural equation models that are tightly attuned to the features of teaching and learning research but broadly applicable across areas of STEM education. The research integrates four components. The research study (a) derives a new statistical framework and estimators, (b) develops empirical guidelines for study design with the proposed methods using a rich survey of teaching and learning programs and teacher development processes, (c) develops free and accessible software and tutorials, and (d) conducts highly accessible workshops to improve the capacity of the field. \r\n\r\nThis research project is supported by NSF's STEM EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "General abstract\r\n\r\nMost organisms alternate between life stages that vary in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes, in the number of cells they possess, and in the environmental conditions in which they are best adapted to live. Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc. All team members will contribute by writing for blogs produced by professional societies for the public.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nExisting macroalgal taxa samples from across a latitudinal gradient in the western Antarctic Peninsula will be used to explore patterns of genetic diversity from the center to the southern latitudinal limits of their range. Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research on physical processes to convert solar energy to electricity in organic materials. Solar cells, which absorb sunlight and generate electricity, are playing and will continue to play a strong role in reducing the demand for fossil-fuel derived energy. Solar cells constructed out of organic molecules or polymers are of interest because they are inexpensive, easy to process, lightweight and flexible. The electric power generated by today’s organic solar cells is limited because of thermodynamic constraints. There is currently intense scientific effort to overcome these constraints and to construct solar cells that yield higher power. A promising approach is to use singlet fission, a photophysical process within which the electrical current generated by light absorption is in principle doubled. Practical utilization of singlet fission requires further research. Charge generation here occurs in two steps, and while impressive success has been reached in the development of chromophores in which the first step is very efficient, in nearly all cases the second step takes too long, and electric charge, and so, energy, is lost to the process of recombination. The PI will perform quantum chemical calculations that will lead to new molecular materials in which the second step of singlet fission, charge separation, will occur ultrafast, leading to organic solar cells with higher quantum efficiencies. A significant portion of the research is in collaboration with groups that specialize in experimental research on singlet fission. The broader impacts of this work include interdisciplinary training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, outreach efforts fostering interest in chemistry and physics among members of underserved groups, and increased scientific literacy and public awareness.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the process of singlet fission in organic solar cell materials. Research on singlet fission until recently focused on designing materials that give rapid singlet to triplet-triplet conversion. Rapid triplet-triplet generation; however, is a consequence of strong interchromophore coupling that also leads to strong triplet-triplet multiexciton binding and fast triplet recombination instead of generation of free triplets. Overcoming this impasse requires clear understanding of the relationship between bonding motifs and the generation of triplet-triplet multiexcitons with weak binding energy, that have been discovered recently in different families of intramolecular singlet fission materials. The PI will perform high order multiple reference configuration interaction-calculations within the semiempirical Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian using a diagrammatic exciton basis that will yield precise structure-property correlations with predictive capability. The goal of this research is to arrive at structural features that will give fast generation of free triplets in ultrafast times. The research contributes to fundamental knowledge that underlies solar energy and other technologies, particularly those that could be based on organic materials. Junior researchers involved in this project are gaining experience in state-of-the-art computational methods, including quantum many-body physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Quantitative study of morphology is central to many fields within the biological sciences, as anatomical systems hold important clues on how organism move, feed, reproduce and interact with the environment in which they live in. Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues.

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a novel biocompatible gel to improve the effectiveness and safety of thermal tumor ablation procedures. The technology enhances the energy medium of radiofrequency energy, resulting in more effective electroporation of tumors, increasing the therapeutic concentration of energy while minimizing unintended damage to surrounding fluids or tissues. The technological medium aims to improve procedural outcomes for the $800 million and $2.7 billion worldwide image-guided thermal ablation market, with broad applicability for a wide variety of ablation procedures, including those performed for endometrial bleeding, pain management, spinal decompression and denervation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and emphysema reduction.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to develop a novel protein-based gel for improving procedural outcomes during focal tumor ablation procedures. This novel material provides a viscous fluid medium for focusing radiofrequency energy intensity to its intended target area in order to intensify localized energy delivery.  During the first phase, a computational model will be developed using 3D microwave imaging under simulated clinical conditions to predict the thermal behavior of the gel.  During the second phase, preclinical data will be collected using liver, kidney, and muscle tissue in vivo preclinical models and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify temperatures, ablation zone size, and thermal energy deposition. During the third stage, the gel’s effects during tissue ablation will be assessed using in vivo porcine lung and standard non-invasive clinical imaging methods. During the fourth phase, an in vivo chronic safety study will be completed. Upon completion, the results from these milestones will provide the necessary preclinical evidence to initiate first in human studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project specifically seeks to use stable oxygen isotopes (δ18O) measured in cellulose from the annual growth rings of trees located in Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile to reconstruct wet season precipitation variability for at least the last 200 years across the neotropics to glean insights on large-scale tropical climate dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe general goal of the research is to understand recent and potential future changes in the position and width of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and how these changes may be tied to global modes of climate variability and could affect patterns of tropical rainfall in both the northern (NH) and southern (SH) hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe rational for the research strategy of using isotopes from tree cellulose is that the relative paucity of tree-ring records in tropical regions (a large geographic area and extensive ecosystem) prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the range of climate variability particularly at decadal to centennial time scales and in response to changes in radiative forcing. Such data are otherwise unavailable from modern observations, pilot studies, and paleoclimate data elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include support for a postdoctoral researcher as well as graduate undergraduate students involved in the research and extensive interaction with international researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In general, complex flows - those observed in supersonic-to-hypersonic combustion and propulsion, fusion technologies, and astrophysics - involve multi-material mixing and span a broad range of space and time scales. Fluids participating in such flows have a wide range of molar masses, and in many cases, the flow is highly compressible. It is still a challenge for current engineering tools to predict the key flow physics that arise due to the compressibility and large material property variations. A stronger fundamental understanding of these effects on turbulent flows will significantly increase our ability to model the flow physics accurately, such as the rate of turbulent mixing that occurs in complex multi-material flows, and to perform numerical simulations of such flows with a decreased computational expense. These gained abilities will have a direct impact on the improvement and development of many high-tech products in the space, energy, and defense industries. Therefore, the focus of the proposed study is to quantify the coupled large molar-mass ratio and compressibility effects on the gravitationally driven turbulent flows. The project will also deliver an educational component by generating content for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses. It will also support outreach activities to promote interest in fluid dynamics and turbulence, and more broadly in STEM among local middle-school students.\r\n\r\nMulti-material turbulence has so far mostly been studied with quasi-incompressible and Boussinesq flows with small variations in material properties. The proposed project aims to describe flow compressibility effects on Rayleigh-Taylor unstable turbulent mixing with large density variations beyond the Boussinesq approximation and the incompressible assumption. Novel direct numerical simulations of buoyancy-driven flow that resolve all spatial and temporal scales will be performed at large density ratios (>2) with highly compressible fluids using the adaptive mesh refinement to optimally deploy computational resources. Unique statistical tools will be developed to quantify the non-Boussinesq turbulent compressible mixing dynamics. The proposed simulations and statistical analyses will be used to establish a deeper understanding of turbulence transition for non-Boussinesq flows, and in particular, the small-scale flow topology of the compressible active-scalar mixing. In addition, the findings of this research are expected to inform new sub-grid-scale models and strategies to decrease the computational cost of the multi-physics complex fluid-flow simulations and validate the reduced-order models for these complex flows. This project is jointly funded by Fluid Dynamics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "A major goal of modern probability is to understand the macroscopic behavior of large random systems. This project studies a class of random growth models taking place in different geometric settings and will develop new tools effective for these structures; the aim is to understand the behavior of these systems and the impact of the underlying geometry on this behavior. These systems, for example, might be used to model the growth of cancer along a wall or a cylinder. \r\n\r\nThe extensive algebraic structure underlying integrable or exactly solvable models without boundary has been successfully used to study a variety of probabilistic questions for these models. Many of these models are expected to exhibit universality, meaning that the behavior studied should occur in a wide variety of other models. However, once non-trivial boundary conditions are imposed, our understanding is incomplete. The proposal aims to develop a better understanding of the algebraic structures involved once boundary conditions are imposed and to use this structure to attack probabilistic problems. In particular, the work aims to find new hidden symmetries for these models and to establish asymptotic results via new exact formulas for models with boundary. Undergraduate students will participate in the research, continuing the awardee's record of student mentorship, and the work will be disseminated at seminars and conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Cilia are flexible hair-like appendages commonly used to create fluid motion in biological systems, facilitating swimming, feeding, reproduction, and other functional behaviors. Typical cilia are tens of microns long, but ctenophores (comb jellies) use cilia at much larger scales—around a millimeter in length. At small scales, ciliary flow is highly constrained by fluid viscosity. However, at larger scales, inertia becomes more important, leading to quantitative and qualitative differences in the velocities and forces produced by the cilia. These differences will be explored with a combination of laboratory experiments and computational simulations, using ctenophores as a model system for large-scale cilia. A better understanding of the fluid dynamics of cilia across scales will provide new tools to ask and answer questions related to biology, ecology, and the fundamental physics of how flexible structures create flow across scales. This knowledge may lead to new developments in engineering, including bioinspired devices, sensors, and robots. The project will also include the development of several educational components, including a new module on the viscous-inertial transition for high school physics students and outreach activities for young women interested in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to understand the physical principles that govern ciliary flows from low to intermediate Reynolds numbers. This study will explicitly examine the effects of substrate geometry and deformability on ciliary flows. A combined experimental-numerical approach will be used to investigate hydrodynamic interactions of multiple flexible propulsors at low-to-intermediate Reynolds numbers and develop useful scaling laws. The experimental approach will employ both planar and volumetric particle image velocimetry to visualize the flows generated by living ctenophores across a range of animal and propulsor sizes. The material properties of the ciliary substrate (mesoglea) will also be characterized during the investigation. These results will guide the development of a scalable computational fluid dynamics model, which will be used to investigate the larger parameter space of ciliary flow generation across scales. The project will focus on the effects of three key variables: (i) propulsor kinematics, including the degree of bending and spatiotemporal asymmetry; (ii) substrate geometry, from flat to curved; and (iii) substrate deformability, from rigid to highly deformable. This integrated approach will enable an in-depth investigation of how flexible structures generate flow across the viscous-inertial transition, and the development of broadly applicable scaling principles to guide future technology development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is a new ultra low-cost carbon-oxygen battery that provides high energy density long-duration storage with unique fundamental properties needed to enable 100% renewable energy. This closed-loop stationary energy storage system will turn intermittent solar/wind power into on-demand power at lower cost than fossil fuel generation. Additionally, its high energy density (3x lighter and smaller than Lithium-ion batteries at system level) will enable longer range electric ships, trucks, etc. – a secondary target market – and a much more compact size for stationary storage than other batteries at the same energy capacity. The project will provide insight into the scale-up potential and design parameters of key battery components. Achieving 100% sustainable energy will have a wide range of societal impacts including minimizing environmental impact and improving human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project for the carbon-oxygen battery will thus focus on key technology development of the core components by modeling, building, and testing. This will involve assembling an array of small-scale prototype reactors to screen configurations and iterate on the design, followed by scale up to a larger megawatt-hour (MWh) scale reactors to integrate into a demo system.  The objectives of the Phase II project will focus on optimizing the reactor to achieve the key target metrics, including objectives to: 1) create and validate a multi-physics model of the optimized reactor, 2) design the optimized reactor, operating conditions, and materials, and 3) build and test several optimized reactors and show that the best design has the potential to fulfill the target metrics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nThis projects aims to describe the properties of so-called nematic phases in a variety of materials. The defining feature of nematic phases is orientational order in that the individual molecules are generally aligned along the same direction, yet their location is disordered. As a consequence, these materials flow like a normal fluid, yet they display solid like features when forces affect their orientational order. Such a hybrid nature is key to recent applications in flow control, material shape design and engineering, even actuation and soft robotics induced by light. More widely, a number of biological tissues exhibit the same properties in that oriented individual cells respond as a nematic phase, and such a response is involved in biological function. Theories to be developed in this project will describe the properties and response of those nematic materials that are comprised of complex molecular units, such a long organic molecules, stacks of individual disks in solution, or aggregates of living cells. The theory will pay special attention to defects in nematic phases. These are small regions in which the orientational order is broken, and that are known to determine the characteristic properties of the material. Such an observation lies at the center of recent efforts in the so-called defect engineering field, which seeks not to eliminate defects, but rather to produce them and to control their location and motion in order to produce material properties that would be unachievable in ideal materials without defects. A theoretical understanding of defects, their interactions, and their motion is central to enable further advances in defect engineering and the many applications that are currently being explored involving nematic phases.\r\n\r\nOn the educational side, the project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students, the latter through Summer internships and Honors Thesis projects. In addition, the PI has created and is teaching a new senior undergraduate course PHYS 4041, “Computational Methods in the Physical Sciences'' which is taken by students in Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering. The course involves semester long computational projects, many of which are drawn from examples of the research in this project. As the research proposed overlaps with Physics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Computational Science, there are many opportunities to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, including Honors projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nThis project addresses morphology, topological defects, and nonequilibrium transport in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals, both theoretically and through large scale computation. This material is studied in its nematic phase which displays long range orientational order with characteristic elastic response and defected textures. The research is motivated by recent developments in experimental diagnostics that give, for the first time, access to quantitative detail in the sub-micron range near topological singularities of the nematic director field, as well as related determinations of the material's elastic constants and rheology. These developments open the door to quantitative theories of liquid crystals with complex molecular architectures, extension to many realistic natural systems of the well-known small molecule and isotropic limits. This is necessary as nematic response is under active scrutiny in applications of active and biological matter that display nematic order.\r\n\r\nA self-consistent field theory is proposed to determine free energies of elastically anisotropic nematics. Phenomenological gradient expansions as in, for example, the Landau-de Gennes theory, lead to unbounded energies to the lowest order necessary to incorporate anisotropy. The functional space to the next order that is necessary to restore boundedness is too large to make the theory viable or useful. A computational implementation of a singular potential method has been introduced as an alternative. It has been validated with experimental determinations of singularity profiles in lyotropic chromonics, as well as with equilibrium morphologies of two phase tactoids. This method will be extended into a field theory that can accommodate two distinct features of chromonics: the microscopic units are charged aggregates, and of length that can change depending on distortion. Novel behavior is expected because the complexity of the interactions in lyotropics manifests itself in very small twist elastic constants, leading to novel modes of disclination interactions in three dimensions, to the appearance of configurations with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and even to propagating localized structures. The analysis will be fully three-dimensional and framed within a newly introduced topological invariant for uniaxial phases and an exact kinematic law for the motion of disclinations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical Abstract: The ability of a solid to conduct electricity and heat determines its application potential in new technologies such as microelectronics. Surprisingly, quantum physics predicts that the electricity- and heat- carrying capabilities of a solid at the nanometer scale do not reduce continuously with decreased cross-section. This quantum theory has been validated repeatedly in different experiments for both the electricity- and heat-carrying capabilities of electrons in different nanostructures. In comparison, there has been only one reported experimental observation of the predicted quantum behavior of the heat-carrying ability in a polycrystalline silicon nitride nanostructure. In response to a call for further experimental investigations of the quantum theory of lattice heat transport, this project is focused on experimental investigation of this quantum theory in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a unique measurement method. Success of this research is expected to both enhance the understanding of a essential pillar of condensed matter physics and provide education and outreach opportunities for broadening the participation in quantum and thermal science research and technology developments.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Free of two-level defects, SWCNTs are closest to an ideal one-dimensional (1D) quantum system among the nanostructures that have been experimentally realized. The goal of this work is to advance multiprobe measurements of the intrinsic thermal conductance of 1D nanostructures for accurate detection of the quantized phonon conductance that has been predicted for a SWCNT at a relatively high temperature up to about 10 K. This temperature range is much more conducive to producing unambiguous experimental evidence of quantized phonon conductance than the below-0.8 K temperature required for prior studies of silicon nitride nanobeams. If successful, the proposed measurements of SWCNTs will establish an experimental capability for detecting and controlling quantized phonon transport behaviors of low-dimensional systems. This capability is expected to advance the frontier of experimental research in a foundational area of condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education designed to advance understanding of materials that conduct electricity but contain electrons that apply strong forces on each other which led to new states of electronic matter. These quantum materials have novel properties. The PI will use model calculations for electrons in materials classes known as cuprates and iron-based superconductors, as well as others, to study several challenging problems directed towards a broader understanding of how these materials work. He will also work with a local science museum to prepare exhibits on superconductivity and magnetism for the public, and organize events designed to encourage young women students and researchers to consider a career in physics.\r\n\r\nSuperconductivity is the quantum state of many electrons in a metal that is characterized by the loss of all electrical resistance and consequently of all dissipation of energy. The PI will explore the interplay between the fundamental physics of superconductors and other phases of matter, including magnetic ones, which tend to form when superconductivity is suppressed. In addition, he will explore the effect of chemical impurities, where an atom in a crystal is replaced by a different element, as well as effects of other defects always present when crystals or films are grown. In particular, how these impurities determine the phases that are realized will be addressed.  For example, “islands” or droplets of a secondary phase may appear in the dominant phase of a superconductor. Thus, the PI will explore models of the effect of impurities and other real-life defects on the properties of these superconducting materials. The PI will focus especially on the theory of how to interpret results from scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. This technique reveals atomic-resolution images of the quantum states of a material by applying a voltage to a tiny sharp metal tip as it is scanned over the material's surface - effectively taking an atomic-scale “photograph” of the quantum state. Information obtained from theoretical calculations and the analysis of data from these experiments may provide key insights into the interplay of superconductivity and other quantum states including magnetism and a novel “electronic nematic” state of electrons that is a quantum mechanical analog of states that make liquid crystal displays possible.  One consequence of these investigations may be a deeper insight into the nature of high temperature superconductivity and how it can be further optimized, which could have technological implications.  Understanding the properties of these quantum materials and the influence of disorder may also lead to novel properties that can be utilized in new devices and technologies, such as sensors with unusual sensitivity operating near boundaries among competing phases in highly correlated metals.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to address long-standing fundamental problems involving the interplay of quenched disorder and various types of competing emergent order in correlated electron systems. The materials to be investigated include cuprate and iron-based superconductors, as well as other quantum materials displaying competing orders. The PI will study properties of electronic systems through a careful analysis of the behavior of simplified models of interacting electrons on the lattice, informed in some cases by density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations with appropriate inclusion of correlations. There are three main projects:\r\n\r\n1.  Effects of disorder on overdoped cuprates. The PI will perform a series of investigations on the cuprate materials that can be doped well past optimal doping, to illustrate the unexpected effects of scattering from out-of-plane dopants, and test the materials-specific theory of impurity scattering developed using Wannier function-derived scattering potentials from DFT. The PI and his group will develop materials-specific impurity potentials to understand normal- and superconducting-state transport where forward scattering from impurities can be important, in particular the angle-dependent elastic mean free path observed in resistivity measurements, as well as Terahertz conductivity.    Some of this work will be done in collaboration with a group at Simon Fraser University.  \r\n  Even in the overdoped cuprates, there  is a substantial discrepancy between the resistive Tc and the T where the gap closes.  The team will try to calculate how much of the gap filling phenomenon is due to disorder-induced inhomogeneity near the transition, that is, when the system breaks up into small islands of good superconductor that are weakly proximity coupled.  These phenomenological studies will be supplemented by microscopic studies of spin fluctuation theory, where the doping dependence of the intrinsic pairing interaction is Hubbard-type and modified by disorder, to study the disappearance of Tc on the overdoped side.\r\n\r\n2. STM of charge and pair density waves. Much of the physical information available on competing order and inhomogeneity arises from scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy on high quality surfaces; yet the theory to interpret such data is available only in very primitive form. The PI will use microscopic Wannier functions from ab initio calculations to construct local Green's functions in both superconducting and metallic states to compare with experiments on charge and pair density waves, calculating the local density of states above the sample surface where measurements are actually performed.  In particular, the PI will develop the theory of scanning Josephson spectroscopy to calculate the local critical current using the Wannier function continuum representation, in both the coherent and diffusive regimes to compare with Josephson STM experiments currently being performed.  Understanding the properties of correlated electron systems and the influence of disorder may lead to novel materials properties that can be utilized in new devices and technologies, obtaining unusual sensitivity by operating near transitions between competing phases that occur in highly correlated electron systems.\r\n\r\n3.  Thermal transport and penetration depth in uranium ditelluride with elastic scattering. The spin-triplet heavy fermion superconductor uranium ditelluride is still quite mysterious and the structure of the superconducting gaps are unknown.  Thermal conductivity experiments suggest point nodes, while penetration depth experiments imply that the nodes may be distributed away from high symmetry points.  The PI will develop the theory of both experimental probes for triplet states to settle these issues, including nonunitary ones proposed to explain Kerr effect and muon spin resonance indications of time reversal symmetry breaking.   He will further investigate the role of disorder in producing these signals.  \r\n\r\nThis award also supports outreach activities including: designing a new exhibit on electrical conduction and superconductivity for the recently opened Cade Museum for Innovation, organizing U. Florida Activities in support of United Nations Women and Girls in Science Day, and developing and delivering public lectures. Software developed for the calculation of spin fluctuation pairing, and a database for Wannier functions in unconventional superconductors, will be made available through the PI's website and GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel, surgically implanted device for treating female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Nearly 50% of women in the U.S. will suffer from stress urinary incontinence with age resulting in over 40 million suffering women by 2050. No pharmacological solutions currently exist and mesh-based midurethral slings (MUS) are the mainstay surgical option, even though they are associated with various long-term complications, challenges, and risks. Furthermore, all SUI repair products on the market are polypropylene mesh-based with no alternatives available. This project aims to address this gap in options with a mesh-free, sling-free, outpatient transvaginal repair device for female urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and validate a novel, transvaginal surgical procedural technology for treating stress urinary incontinence. This project progresses findings from the SBIR Phase I project which demonstrated functional proof-of-concept biomechanical feasibility. This Phase II project aims to further the surgical procedure and system in a manner suitable for human use. The scope of technical activities includes design optimization, mechanical testing and validation, surgical procedure validation, biocompatibility testing, and histological characterization in a series of benchtop, cadaveric, and animal studies. The scope of the activities will be conducted in accordance with practices needed to demonstrate chronic implanted safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models in order to gain eventual U.S. regulatory approval.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the first fully implantable, subcutaneous system for treating 200,000 infants born with congenital conditions causing impaired growth of the skull or mandible. These abnormalities affect basic functions including breathing, hearing, speech, visual function, neurologic development, and mastication. Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) is a widely recognized clinical treatment for craniofacial abnormalities that applies controlled mechanical forces to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects by leveraging the natural ability of the body to regenerate bone. Current semi-externalized mechanical design systems restore functional discrepancies but result in issues with patient comfort and adverse events that rely on caregivers to follow precise treatment protocols that hinder widespread adoption. This project aims to develop the first fully subcutaneous, automated DO system for the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) skeleton. Applications include surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder in the adult population, representing potential markets exceeding $10 billion.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a novel, fully implantable craniofacial distraction system comprised of an implantable, magnetically driven mechanism and an external controller driver. The system aims to significantly improve upon existing distraction osteogenesis surgical designs by removing an external component that protrudes through the patient’s skin using a novel implantable magnetic driver design. The novel design enables manual mechanical device adjustment capable of providing the necessary distraction forces in a safe and reliable manner, while eliminating the principal path of complications and treatment noncompliance. The proposed benefits would reduce the risks of infection, device dislodgement, analgesic use, patient stigma, required manual operation, and treatment noncompliance. This project aims to reduce the key critical remaining engineering design risks including system usability issues prior to clinical use and manufacturability. Upon completion of the project, the prototypes will undergo in vivo testing in preclinical models prior to human use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is in the development of a visual unilateral neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation tool for stroke patients.  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability, including the cost of healthcare services, medicines and missed days of work. Stroke related costs in the United States are around $50 billion every year. Unilateral spatial neglect (neglect) is a disabling neurocognitive impairment for stroke patients occurring in 28.60% of the stroke population.  Moreover, neglect is a strong predictor of disability, and stroke patients with neglect have longer hospital stays and receive more direct treatment time from physical and occupational therapists than individuals without neglect, culminating in significantly higher healthcare costs.  However, there is currently no commercial product targeting neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation. Current clinical gold standard neglect detection methods are affected by compensatory strategies and are not sensitive to changes in the severity of neglect; and rehabilitation techniques are not effective in reducing disability associated with neglect.  This project, through a multidisciplinary team, will address these issues while developing the proposed neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation tool that incorporates stimulation to draw attention to the affected side of the body and environment based on the automatic detection of neglect through neurophysiology measured through electroencephalography, thereby stimulating neural networks responsible for spatial attention and perceptual processing for stroke patients. Stimulation during everyday activities with high levels of repetition is needed to promote implicit learning that supports generalization of learning and independence.  Current detection and rehabilitation methods lack the necessary precision, salience, and repetition to promote this type of learning. Due to limitations associated with these methods, there is no gold assessment for neglect or standard of care for rehabilitation of neglect in routine clinical practice. The proposed project offers a potential solution to these problems, incorporating best practices from rehabilitation intervention research and state-of-the-art technologies that will be cost-effective to be implemented in rehabilitation clinics. The proposed technology incorporates objective and reliable quantification of neglect severity and tailored sensory stimulation that is: (i) technology-driven (accurate, reliable, repetitive, cost-effective); (ii) multimodal: visual, auditory, haptic stimulation (optimizes perceptual processing); (iii) individualized to the available field of vision; and (iv) simultaneous with ``real-world'' activities of daily living .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) project provides a high-quality, publicly available data resource for the empirical study of international conflict. The data include all international interactions, by any state in any location, short of war but where the state has intentionally involved or invoked the military by way of threat, show, or use of force against another state. This project, MID6, will update coverage through 2024 and standardize data collection methods for future updates. It will also create MID-Live for the early release of candidate data and for near real-time incident detection. MID6 is critical for all organizations and individuals concerned with national security in general, and militarized interactions between states in particular. It will provide interested parties with the opportunity to develop an analytical understanding of when national security incidents are likely to escalate to military force or are likely to be managed short of this point. It will provide information on evolving patterns of conflict and competition between nation-states, as well as opportunities for cooperation. In essence, MID6 will advance our understanding of the conditions under which conflict, cooperation, and competition are more likely to occur. This project will also bring societal benefits through a focus on providing research experience for students from historically excluded and minoritized backgrounds, as well as cadets from the U.S. Air Force Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data are a primary resource for the study of international conflict and are regularly used in the field of international relations. The current data have coverage from 1816 to 2014. This effort, MID6, will update coverage through 2024, providing an additional ten years of data on militarized interstate incidents and disputes involving any country in any location. It will incorporate research with new tools and technological innovations, specifically in the areas of natural language processing, promote graduate student training, and provide extensive research experience for undergraduates including cadets and members of historically excluded and minoritized populations. It will standardize data collection procedures for ongoing updates beyond 2024 and will provide the highest levels of transparency and accessibility in the data collection process. This project will also create MID-Live for the early release of candidate data and for near real-time incident detection. Through official project channels, for example social media accounts and the MID website hosted by the Correlates of War project, it will identify and publicize MID incidents as they occur. By releasing data faster, MID-Live will improve input data to forecasting models and conflict monitoring systems, as well as provide analysts objective data on conflicts as they occur. Overall, the expansion of the MID data through 2024 and the new innovations ensure that researchers and analysts have the data they need to study and understand international conflict.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance clinical methods that address the extensive physiological variation that is age- and race-dependent. Well-publicized over the last few decades is the lack of healthcare solutions for diseases in preemie babies, who are born to mothers with significant socioeconomic inequalities. Case in point, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and often fatal gastrointestinal, or gut, emergency in premature infants that disproportionately affects African American babies. The disease has not only confounded doctors and nurses for 200 years, but also these neonatal emergencies are also frightening to almost all preemie care providers due to its high mortality rate.  Its healthcare in the US requires $3 billion annually due to repeated x-ray testing, surgery, longer hospital stays, and long-term complications of its survivors. An early and accurate diagnostic test for NEC would be a disruptive paradigm shift in preemie intensive care: it would enable medical intervention to be more effective, reduce risk of disease progression, decrease medical care expenses by hundreds of millions annually, and lower mortality.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop requisite reagents for a diagnostic test that will enable detection of infant proteins that play a role in gut health.  Absolute quantitation is a prerequisite for data interpretation and validation between experiments, laboratories, and testing platforms. Research objectives are directed toward critical technical hurdles: (1) determination of optimal reference standard to quantitate host biomolecules in clinical settings and (2) understanding the usage limitations of these reference standards in the background of high variation in the human population. Native and recombinant candidates will be compared and analyzed with various methods.  Anticipated results are reference standards that are age-specific for diagnostic use in the most fragile and smallest patients and that are acceptable to regulatory stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel device which reduces injury to patients by emergency personnel when using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) manual resuscitator. BVMs are used in pre-hospital and hospital settings by emergency medical personnel on a daily basis to deliver air to critically ill patients. Their basic design has been in place for over 60 years and are often misused resulting in damage, complications, or occasionally fatal lung injury. This project will complete development of a novel BVM that precisely controls the volumes and pressures delivered, and aims to redefine the stagnant BVM market which is projected to surpass $750M annually by 2025.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, adjustable, universal bag-valve-mask resuscitator enabling emergency providers to deliver air volumes and pressures customized to patient body size. Current devices are commonly misused, even by highly trained medical personnel, resulting in hyperventilation, barotrauma, and occasional death. The project will complete remaining design and testing tasks, and a human factors proof of concept study to demonstrate users are able to quickly and properly utilize the device with minimal instruction will be performed. The second objective will address manufacturability and testing requirements within standards for US approval. Finally, the third objective is to establish the assembly processes and initial quality control testing to ensure consistent manufacturing at scale and in a cost effective and quality consistent manner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Barrier-island communities face flooding due to rising sea levels and stronger storms, and typical adaptations (protect, accommodate, retreat) may not keep up with increasing risks. Communities are now considering extreme adaptations, such as allowing an island section to ‘return to nature’ by removing roadways and other infrastructure. But these extreme adaptations transform the natural processes of and the community’s relationship with barriers. The effects on flood risks at nearby communities are not well understood, and it is not clear whether communities will ‘welcome the water’ or reject it as opposing their sense of place. This Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project explores participatory transformation of barriers. Stakeholders will provide insights on place meanings across the barrier island and how floods affect these places and their connections to the community. The project also quantifies how flooding at a natural island section may change the hazard at neighboring communities, and whether these locations can be selected to minimize the risks while maximizing community attachments. These activities provide a framework for participatory transformation, as well as advance technologies for flood risk modeling that can be expanded to improve disaster resilience for communities along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts. This research also supports an immersive experience for students to collaborate across engineering and social-science disciplines to tackle the challenges of climate change.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project advances understanding of how local erosion events contribute to floods at neighboring communities; how these floods can be managed by allowing barrier sections to return to nature; and how such a transformation, when informed and deliberated by community stakeholders, may affect community place meanings. The research will be organized on the following objectives: (O1) identify ‘acceptable’ locations for extreme adaptation of barrier systems; (O2) quantify reductions in flood risk from extreme adaptations at ‘acceptable’ and other locations; and (O3) assess changes in stakeholders’ perceptions about extreme adaptation techniques for barrier islands. Via high-resolution modeling of flooding subject to possible barrier configurations and future climate scenarios, this project quantifies the scales of flooding at neighboring communities. And via science co-production, this project investigates how the community’s attachment to the barrier island may be increased if stakeholders take an active role in the transformation. This project uses transformative research approaches and engagement to facilitate new approaches to community-led management and adaptation of barriers, enable improved efforts to plan for the consequences of landform changes and development, and advance the integration of the coastal science, engineering, and adaptation disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Damaging thunderstorm-wind events in the US outnumber those of tornadoes by an order of magnitude, with greater cumulative losses. Most notably, the August 2020 derecho event in the Midwest US was the costliest thunderstorm event in US history at over $13Billion in losses. Critical questions regarding the mechanisms for such extreme wind generation remain unanswered, partly because, relative to tornadoes, thunderstorm winds have been understudied both by meteorologists and engineers. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will examine how characteristics of thunderstorm winds, including design-level peak wind speeds, relate to the different generating mechanisms of such winds. The project will also investigate spatial variabilities and temporal intermittencies associated with these mechanisms, which will contribute to the fundamental understanding of thunderstorm-wind generation and the variability observed in the field. The underlying focus of the project on hazardous thunderstorms will ultimately lead to better forecasts and warnings of thunderstorm-wind events, and to integration of the findings into building codes and standards. In addition, the project will train a new generation of interdisciplinary engineers and scientists who appreciate both the basic scientific problem, and the engineering solutions.\r\n\r\nConceptual wind-damage models, especially for engineering, have focused on the “downburst” as being responsible for all extreme winds near the surface. However, there are other mechanisms for thunderstorm wind generation including the rear-inflow jet (RIJ) and mesovortices, which may be responsible for a significant proportion of damage from thunderstorms. RIJ-induced winds are suspected in the August 2020 derecho based on early results from numerical simulations.  This project will examine alternative forcing mechanisms by combining existing observational data from the August 2020 derecho and other high-impact events, with post-event damage surveys, and to-be-developed high-resolution numerical simulations of convective-storm events. Three major research tasks will tease out the different mechanisms: (1) Numerical simulations of specific events, with resolution sufficient for determination of the wind-generation mechanism and associated forcings and reduced-complexity dynamical modeling to relate the wind forcings to the detailed characteristics of the thunderstorm winds. (2) Wind engineering analysis, which will match/compare the modeling results of specific events to existing thunderstorm wind data and post-event damage data as well as an analysis of the data generated from the higher resolution numerical models. This analysis will include four-dimensional assessment of engineering-relevant characteristics such as peak wind speed, wind speed profiles, and comparisons to existing engineering models of thunderstorm winds. (3) Climatological analysis of thunderstorm winds in the US, with specific interest in sub-classifying these winds by their generation mechanism (RIJ, downburst, mesovortex). Each mechanism will be assessed for their importance in wind loading of structures through the engineering characteristics in (2). This will connect the results from (1) and (2).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "A seismic event often involves multiple hazards (e.g., ground shaking, landslide, and liquefaction) and impacts (e.g., building and infrastructure damage). Understanding the locations and extents of such hazards and impacts in high resolution immediately after an event is critical for facilitating real-time responses, such as timely evacuation, search and rescue, and effective allocations of limited resources.  Researchers have been investigating using satellite imageries to extract hazard and impact information for wide affected areas; however, the co-occurrence and co-location of hazards and impacts result in mixed signals in satellite imagery, making it very challenging to directly categorize and estimate each hazard and associated impacts. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project aims to develop a novel system to provide rapid, scalable, and joint assessments of cascading seismic hazards and impacts by leveraging the causal dependencies among them. It will enhance the accuracy, resolution, and timeliness of existing rapid disaster information systems by integrating satellite images with existing geospatial hazard models from The US Geological Survey and building fragility functions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s HAZUS tool. The revealed regional causal mechanisms aims to enable improved seismic risk analysis as well as the study of other natural disasters involving cascading impacts. This will improve overall community resilience to future natural disasters.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a causality-informed variational Bayesian network modeling framework to adaptively provide regional-scale seismic multi-hazard and impact occurrence estimates in near-real-time, by fusing information from satellite images with prior geophysical knowledge and building fragility functions through a deep causal Bayesian network. First, a novel paradigm will be established to model complex and implicit causal dependencies among cascading seismic multi-hazards and impacts as a flow-based causal Bayesian network to integrate information from prior hazards and impact models with mixed-signal satellite imagery. Further, an online variational Bayesian inference framework will be developed to jointly infer and update, in a scalable and efficient manner, the estimations of seismic multi-hazards and impacts, with or without partially observed ground truth. Third, local geospatial hazards model and building fragility functions will be updated through a novel uncertainty-aware prior model updating scheme using the event-specific patterns learned from the causal Bayesian network. The quantitative causal mechanisms of cascading seismic hazards and building damage, revealed by the causal Bayesian network, will be characterized in multiple earthquake events, to render an in-depth understanding of event-specific seismic hazards and damage patterns for improving regional resilience to future disaster events. The framework will be demonstrated on seven moderate-to-large global earthquake events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In reinforced concrete buildings, cast-in-place floor slabs, or “diaphragms”, must resist both gravity loads, the weight of the structure and building contents, and horizontal loads, caused by wind or the inertia of the floors during earthquakes. For the building to function, these floor diaphragms also must contain openings for stairs, elevators, and mechanical systems. Although the presence of these openings is accounted for when designing the structure for gravity loads, there is little research or understanding of how they affect the building’s behavior during earthquake loading. The potential consequences of this lack of understanding were recently demonstrated during earthquake simulator tests on a five-story reinforced concrete building. Unexpected diaphragm damage during testing indicates that openings adjacent to walls and columns contribute to collapse risk and could preclude or delay the return of a building’s functionality after a seismic event. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings and develop tools for their design and for probabilistically quantifying their expected performance during an earthquake. The research will be complemented by an online class curriculum focusing on accurate simulation approaches and their validation, for both students and practitioners, as part of the recently established earthquake engineering certificate program and outreach to engage underrepresented minority and first-generation college students in research.\r\n\r\nThis award will focus on advancing science-based tools and technologies, through simulation-driven experimental testing and nonlinear finite element analysis of prototype buildings under multiple hazard intensities, for the collapse-resistant and recovery-based earthquake engineering of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings. This research will investigate (1) accurate load paths, including fanned collection patterns from regions of low stress to struts, which form the primary load path; (2) the impact of openings and establishing protected zones to mitigate damage that could lead to partial collapse; and (3) damage states and fragility curves that quantify diaphragm performance for inclusion in functional recovery methodologies. Several fundamental research questions will be answered, including (1) what is the inertial load path through the diaphragm, and how are these load paths affected by openings; (2) how does the slab thickness, reinforcement, and the presence of openings affect the capacity of diaphragm elements subjected to complex in-plane stresses; (3) how does the presence of openings modify the effective stiffness of diaphragms, and what is the effect on engineering demand parameters; (4) what is the relationship between engineering demand parameters, ground motion intensity measures, and diaphragm damage; and (5) how does diaphragm damage around openings affect safety, story access, and tenet functionality. Equally important, this project will form the foundation for additional research to fully investigate the lateral force resisting system, including slab-wall and slab-column connections, using pseudo-dynamic and earthquake simulator testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Wildfires can have detrimental effects on the safety, economy, and well-being of affected communities with the risk borne disproportionately by disadvantaged communities. A critical factor that can prevent wildfires from turning into a human disaster is “access,” which refers to the ease of reaching shelters and is the product of both mobility and location of shelters. Despite its crucial importance, the state-of-the-art solutions and practices currently lack a systematic framework that determines access during wildfire events while incorporating equity considerations. The overarching goal of this Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project is to incorporate equity into wildfire preparedness strategies and minimize the equity of access gap to resources between disadvantaged and advantaged communities. The adverse effects of wildfires can be mitigated if a community understands its existing vulnerabilities and adapts strategic preparedness plans before a disaster to build resilience. Wildfire preparedness strategies, however, must be formulated and implemented through the lens of equity and justice. For example, for residents who do not have access to transportation, a simple task like locating and driving to an American Red Cross shelter is not feasible.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project develops a science-informed community-based solution for disadvantaged communities to augment equity discrepancies and community resilience to the devasting impacts of the ongoing challenge for residents of wildfire-prone areas. It fulfills three objectives: (i) it quantifies disparities in shelter access between disadvantaged and advantaged communities, (ii) it optimizes access-related equity through short- and long-term wildfire preparedness strategies, and (iii) it develops a science-based community-centered interactive strategic planning platform for public officials and community members. This is exercised in close collaboration with our community partners in Lake County, California, where 60% of the land has burned between 2015 and 2020, possesses key characteristics of an at-risk community, and is home to a significant population of underserved residents, including indigenous people. The potential benefit to society from the researched project is improving the resilience of disadvantaged communities and equipping the community, emergency management, and emergency responders with the knowledge and science-based tools required to make informed decisions and decrease the escapable repercussions on disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "To promote community resilience and equity, this Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project examines a series of place-based, human-centered networks, leveraging micromobility (lightweight vehicles such as bicycles or scooters), community social ties, and resilience hubs, to better meet those impacted by a disaster after the event. In particular, the project investigates the potential role of social networks and micromobility in enhancing the planning and operation of resilience hubs, an emerging infrastructural concept that has the potential to support more equitable disaster response and recovery efforts. The project investigates opportunities and challenges regarding enhancing resilience in two study locations: a metropolitan coastal city and an inland suburban community where the results can inform more equitable transportation operational strategies and preparedness measures for other highly vulnerable regions of the United States. The results of this research can extend the state of knowledge about how micromobility resilience hubs can support social network connectivity, increase community cohesion and capacity, and enhance community and national resilience. Communities and people are at the center of the research, learning from stakeholder expertise and experiences to adapt the resilience hub concept to meet the needs of future resilient cities.\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to understand how micromobility infrastructure and community social networks can be effectively leveraged in disaster response. Using human-centered data and mixed-method analyses, this Disaster Resilience Research Grant project combines social network analysis, qualitative thematic analysis, discrete choice modeling, and agent-based simulations, to model a cohesive network for disaster-prone communities addressing the vulnerabilities of individuals and the community. The objectives of this project are to 1) understand the functions, usage, and applicability of micromobility in different disaster scenarios; 2) understand how micromobility systems and local social networks can be integrated to better support communities in both every day and disaster scenarios; and 3) validate the applicability of micromobility resilience hubs as connection points for micromobility and social networks in a range of communities and disaster types via the empirical analysis and synthesis of findings from focus groups, surveys, interviews, simulations, and on-the-ground field tests co-designed with community partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Immediately after a major hazard event (e.g., wildfire, earthquake, flood), a prompt assessment of the geographic distribution and severity of infrastructure damage is vital to the success of the emergency response and early recovery planning. This situational awareness is an important part of the decision-making processes that are implemented by facility owners, users, emergency responders and local and state officials. Conversely, a general lack of knowledge about the impacted state of the built environment can lead to a disorganized public response and slower recovery. While a comprehensive assessment of the extent and distribution of infrastructure damage can be obtained from in-person inspections conducted by building professionals, depending on the scale of the event, this can be a lengthy, resource intensive process. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will address this challenge by utilizing principles from artificial intelligence (AI) to develop near real-time infrastructure damage prediction models that can process and utilize different types of data and information (e.g., images, text, tabular data). By advancing our ability to effectively integrate disparate information sources, this project aims to transform the way that physical damage to infrastructure is estimated in the aftermath of a major disaster event, thereby enhancing the emergency response and recovery planning phases that follow. The research will provide training for doctoral and masters students and an opportunity to teach undergraduates from different backgrounds how science and engineering coupled with AI technologies can be used to improve community response to extreme events.\r\n\r\nFundamental concepts and methodological advancements in multimodal learning will be used to transform and enhance infrastructure damage prediction models for use in the immediate post-event environment. The state-of-the-art in image-based damage assessment will be advanced along two dimensions: (1) developing Vision Transformer-based methods and (2) establishing a self-supervised learning methodology for training the models using large collections of unlabeled data. A new knowledge base will be established around the broad area of multimodal data fusion for infrastructure damage prediction models. Specific questions regarding unified representation, translation across and alignment between modalities and data fusion will be answered. A new type of hazard-agnostic infrastructure damage prediction model will also emerge from this research. Such a model will have the ability to receive an integrated representation of one or more types of input modalities (i.e., image, text, and engineering/tabular data) and produce, as output, an infrastructure damage level that is agnostic to the type of causal event (e.g., earthquake or hurricane). Using a comprehensive data set from multiple natural hazard events (hurricane and earthquake), the project will include experiments to shed new light on the ability of both hazard-specific and hazard-agnostic multimodal models to enhance early-stage infrastructure damage assessments for increased situational awareness and enhanced resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Geoscience as a profession is at a crossroads with respect to attracting individuals from diverse populations and training future geoscientists. Western Oregon University (WOU) will develop a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem, which is a collaborative partnership between a four-year public university, natural resource focused government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and regional geoscience employers. The goal of the partnership is to cultivate Earth science literacy and motivate novel solutions to local environmental issues, while connecting diverse student populations to the geoscience discipline with altruistic motivations for pursuing future careers as professionals. The project will engage and invigorate a new generation of geoscience professionals, particularly those who have been structurally excluded in the sciences. Existing elements of WOU’s Earth and Environmental Science program will be strengthened with the intentional cultivation of an enhanced Geo-STEM learning ecosystem that provides professional mentorship and career-outreach experiences, designed to increase awareness of opportunities for professional outcomes in early career undergraduates who otherwise lack access. \r\n\r\nThe overarching project goal is to strengthen a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem and engage more young people in geosciences at the undergraduate level. The project will focus on mentored geoscience education through development of community water resource partnerships. Given that water resources and river restoration are iconic scientific themes in the Pacific Northwest, the WOU GEOPAths project team has adapted fundamental concepts of floodplain connectivity to the Geo-STEM learning ecosystem model, with the analogous intent of increasing connections between early career undergraduates to the geoscience profession. Specific objectives include: (1) increasing enrollment, diversity, and retention in the geosciences; (2) strengthening the statewide Geo-STEM learning ecosystem by fortifying connections to the professional community; and (3) testing novel approaches to recruitment of diverse populations in the geoscience profession. Extra-curricular experiences and training in the geosciences with a focus on service-learning and workforce training will lead to increased probabilities for student engagement, academic success, and positive career outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The global population has skyrocketed from approximately one billion in 1800 to over eight billion in 2024, driving increased demand for vital and interrelated resources like energy, food, and water. Sustainable approaches are required to meet the escalating energy demand, including resource conservation, energy storage enhancements, and global energy resource management. Addressing the research challenges associated with providing clean energy for the world is a multidisciplinary problem that requires scientists and engineers from diverse fields to collaborate closely. However, the current academic research on sustainable energy is primarily concentrated within traditional academic disciplines. Consequently, academic programs may fail to train graduate students who will enter the energy sector workforce with the essential communication skills and technical expertise to confront these profoundly interdisciplinary challenges. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Boston University (BU) will create an interdisciplinary community of students trained to work collaboratively on sustainable energy research and development. The ENERGIZE project anticipates training 100-125 Ph.D. and master’s students, including 20 funded trainees from a diverse range of disciplines across the university. Trainees will come primarily, but not exclusively, from Ph.D. programs.\r\n\r\nThe technical focus of the ENERGIZE NRT spans research in photochemical conversion, electrochemical conversion, electrochemical storage, and photochemical storage while concurrently providing foundational training for students in physical and computational experimentation and data science. The program has five integrated components: (i) evidence-based experiential learning and interdisciplinary collaborations, (ii) building communications and leadership skills, (iii) career development, (iv) interdisciplinary mentoring, and (v) rigorous program assessment to track learning outcomes. Trainees will develop depth in a particular area of study and breadth across complementary areas of energy conversion, energy storage, sustainability, and data science through coursework, workshops, an internship-based practicum, and mentored laboratory research projects. They will engage in formal activities devoted to professional development, career planning, and skills acquisition through bootcamps, tailored workshops, and leadership opportunities within the NRT community. The project outcomes will include a model for educating scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary research, a research community with technical depth and breadth and a broad understanding of the social impact of sustainable energy and their own research, and educational materials and best practices on research education and professional development.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to build a cross-region innovative research group focused on equitable educational innovations to support historically excluded middle and high school youth–Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC), female-identifying youth, and youth in Title I schools or rural underserved districts–to develop embodied pathways to participation in geosciences communities. The key project activity will be the creation of a practitioner research group composed of community stakeholders, teachers, geoscience faculty, and educational community partners. This group will collaborate to develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation pathways for supporting historically excluded youth in geoscience communities of practice through hands-on fieldwork experiences and digital reflections. The stakeholders will form goals, identify success measures, and work to expand their program’s goals through developing a shared understanding around what equitable participation trajectories look like across similar domains.\r\n\r\nThe effects of underserved youth being excluded from the geosciences is readily reflected in the field however, less is known about the experiences of these youth in such trajectories and how geosciences educational stakeholders could redesign pathways to better serve the students. This project will use methods of community design research to 1) develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation in geoscience fieldwork; 2) develop shared best practices for facilitating more equitable participation in geosciences fieldwork and disciplinary conversations; and 3) support network partners in redesigning programs to set and meet expansive goals in this regard. Over the course of the project, the PI team will build a network of geosciences instructors and practitioners and work on iterative cycles of expanding their programmatic goals in alignment with the five key areas for the following outcomes: 1) Grounded fun; 2) STEM capital; 3) STEM trajectories; 4) STEM identity work; and 5) Agency.\r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to serve the national interest by producing more qualified technicians to meet workforce demands in cybersecurity. Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge in business, industry, and government. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect both existing and emerging technologies. This project will prepare students for cybersecurity technician positions by engaging with employers to strengthen the technical experience that students gain during their courses. The project will also focus on increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation of students from underrepresented groups and will thereby improve the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\nBased at Cypress College, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), this project will build on a previous NSF-funded project, called \"PACE: Pathway to Advance Cybersecurity Education\" (NSF Award DUE-1902519), which developed a pathway from high school (as early as 9th grade) with multiple educational and employment exit points. The new project, known as \"ACE IDEAS: Advanced Cybersecurity Education for Industry-driven, Diversity-minded, Early Aged Students,\" has two main goals: (1) update and augment the PACE cybersecurity courses to include project-based learning, internships, soft skills, and focused preparation for industry certification exams and (2) build program enrollment, persistence, and completion through activities with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups. In particular, the investigators will work closely with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) to align the curriculum with the needs of employers, develop internships, and integrate project-based learning. Other activities will include developing an ePortfolio system for students, developing an industry mentorship program for students, engaging high school students in CyberPatriot and other competitions, and offering workshops on inclusive practices to high school teachers and counselors and college faculty. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to investigate the behavior of quantum systems with many particles, such as electrons in a crystalline solid.  The large number of electrons and their inherent quantum mechanical nature can act in concert leading to new states of matter.  Among these are superconductors, which can conduct electricity with zero resistance, and the quantum Hall states, in which a strong magnetic field causes electrons confined to two dimensions to execute tight circular orbits, thereby forcing net electrical current flow to thei edges of the system.  The goal of the PI’s work is to combine tools from theoretical condensed matter and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these states of quantum matter. \r\n\r\nIn the last few years, quantum computing has motivated significant progress in condensed matter theory.  Quantum computing deals with systems that contain many quantum bits, providing a new perspective on the physics of systems of many quantum mechanical particles that is complementary to the traditional one.  The PI will combine new quantum computing inspired methods with standard condensed matter techniques to gain a better understanding of the landscape of condensed matter phases.  One particular benefit of this program is that some of the exotic condensed matter phases studied by the PI may in turn have applications to the design of new quantum computing platforms.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD.  The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics, and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to classify topological quantum phases of matter, including those that are out of equilibrium and those protected by additional symmetries.  The PI will combine ideas from condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these quantum many-body systems.  Specifically, the PI will connect the topological features of quantum field theories, such as topological terms in continuum effective actions, to topological invariants that can in principle be directly extracted from a lattice Hamiltonian, such as braiding statistics of anyon or defect excitations.  Because a lattice quantum many-body system is essentially a many-qubit system, it is natural that ideas from quantum information theory will naturally be involved in this work.  One quantum information idea is that of a non-trivial quantum cellular automaton, which is a generalization of a shallow-depth circuit of local unitaries.  The PI will explore the utility of using such quantum cellular automatons to disentangle exotic, “beyond-cohomology,” symmetry protected topological phases of matter.\r\n\r\nAn additional tool that the PI plans to use is that of the conformal bootstrap.  This is a numerical technique that constrains the possible conformal field theories that can exist, by putting bounds on their spectra of dimensions of local operators.  Building on preliminary work, the PI's team will research how to constrain the conformal field theories that can exist at the boundaries of topological phases, by incorporating the corresponding 't Hooft anomalies into the conformal bootstrap.  More generally, the aim of the PI will be to determine how to incorporate information about the non-local operators that appear in topological field-theories into the conformal bootstrap.  Furthermore, the PI will also explore topological effects in non-equilibrium settings, such as the recently introduced measurement-induced entanglement transition.  Preliminary work by the PI's team has uncovered, for a certain simple instance of this transition, a dual statistical-mechanics model which exhibits a topological phase transition.  The PI plans to explore more general versions of this duality.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD.  The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards (RIA) provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award will help to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Johnson C. Smith University aims to investigate green technology and its application to inhibit bacterial growth. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the phytochemical constituents found within citrus fruits have natural antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The project is designed to engage undergraduate students in fundamental research, as well as strengthen the research-based pedagogical approaches of the Principal Investigator. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the fundamental plasmonic, Green Nanotechnology (e.g., method/route) response of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) interacting with Streptococcus pneumoniae, is critical in combating the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance. The aims of the proposed study are threefold: (i) Determine the antibiotic influence of plant extraction on the proliferation of various S. pneumoniae isolates, (ii) Examine the effect of Green synthesized AgNPs on planktonic growth of S. pneumoniae, and (iii) Determine the cytotoxicity of green synthesized, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel synthesized Ag Nanoparticles on noncancerous, upper respiratory cell lines. In this study, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel extracts are used as an eco-friendly, reducing and stabilizing agent. The synthesized AgNPs characterization involves using Ultra-violet (UV)-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy, (FTIR), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Zeta Potential, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). While this research addresses alternative approaches to combat bacterial growth against antimicrobial resistant bacteria in a more biological, economical, and eco-friendly manner, the results have the potential to shed light on new knowledge and treatment(s) for medical implants (e.g. catheters, joint prostheses, and pacemakers) and dental implants/orthodontic devices as well as maintenance of pipes/plumbing systems (e.g. biofouling), ship hulls and underwater structures, food processing equipment, and water distribution systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One stumbling block to such research is the need for large sample sizes for studies to be able to make the intended claims. This research develops, and tests new estimation procedures for cross-classified structural equation models for the statistical analysis of small to moderate sample size studies of teaching and learning in mathematics. These new tools reduce the burden of large sample sizes. The team will develop new shareable software tools (in an open-source software application) and deliver training opportunities to researchers. Further, these estimation models and research tools will have broad impact as they are usable for similar study designs in all STEM content learning settings.\r\n\r\nThis research bridges the gap between current research methods and the scale with which most STEM education studies are conducted. The team will develop new estimation methods for small to moderate sample cross-classified structural equation models that are tightly attuned to the features of teaching and learning research but broadly applicable across areas of STEM education. The research integrates four components. The research study (a) derives a new statistical framework and estimators, (b) develops empirical guidelines for study design with the proposed methods using a rich survey of teaching and learning programs and teacher development processes, (c) develops free and accessible software and tutorials, and (d) conducts highly accessible workshops to improve the capacity of the field. \r\n\r\nThis research project is supported by NSF's STEM EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "General abstract\r\n\r\nMost organisms alternate between life stages that vary in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes, in the number of cells they possess, and in the environmental conditions in which they are best adapted to live. Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc. All team members will contribute by writing for blogs produced by professional societies for the public.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nExisting macroalgal taxa samples from across a latitudinal gradient in the western Antarctic Peninsula will be used to explore patterns of genetic diversity from the center to the southern latitudinal limits of their range. Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research on physical processes to convert solar energy to electricity in organic materials. Solar cells, which absorb sunlight and generate electricity, are playing and will continue to play a strong role in reducing the demand for fossil-fuel derived energy. Solar cells constructed out of organic molecules or polymers are of interest because they are inexpensive, easy to process, lightweight and flexible. The electric power generated by today’s organic solar cells is limited because of thermodynamic constraints. There is currently intense scientific effort to overcome these constraints and to construct solar cells that yield higher power. A promising approach is to use singlet fission, a photophysical process within which the electrical current generated by light absorption is in principle doubled. Practical utilization of singlet fission requires further research. Charge generation here occurs in two steps, and while impressive success has been reached in the development of chromophores in which the first step is very efficient, in nearly all cases the second step takes too long, and electric charge, and so, energy, is lost to the process of recombination. The PI will perform quantum chemical calculations that will lead to new molecular materials in which the second step of singlet fission, charge separation, will occur ultrafast, leading to organic solar cells with higher quantum efficiencies. A significant portion of the research is in collaboration with groups that specialize in experimental research on singlet fission. The broader impacts of this work include interdisciplinary training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, outreach efforts fostering interest in chemistry and physics among members of underserved groups, and increased scientific literacy and public awareness.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the process of singlet fission in organic solar cell materials. Research on singlet fission until recently focused on designing materials that give rapid singlet to triplet-triplet conversion. Rapid triplet-triplet generation; however, is a consequence of strong interchromophore coupling that also leads to strong triplet-triplet multiexciton binding and fast triplet recombination instead of generation of free triplets. Overcoming this impasse requires clear understanding of the relationship between bonding motifs and the generation of triplet-triplet multiexcitons with weak binding energy, that have been discovered recently in different families of intramolecular singlet fission materials. The PI will perform high order multiple reference configuration interaction-calculations within the semiempirical Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian using a diagrammatic exciton basis that will yield precise structure-property correlations with predictive capability. The goal of this research is to arrive at structural features that will give fast generation of free triplets in ultrafast times. The research contributes to fundamental knowledge that underlies solar energy and other technologies, particularly those that could be based on organic materials. Junior researchers involved in this project are gaining experience in state-of-the-art computational methods, including quantum many-body physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Quantitative study of morphology is central to many fields within the biological sciences, as anatomical systems hold important clues on how organism move, feed, reproduce and interact with the environment in which they live in. Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them. The project team will also train hundreds of early career scientists, whose research and teaching will benefit from the easy manipulation and use of digital biological specimens. Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources. Proposed cloud services and analytical tools will also make wider-scale, multi-lab collaborations friction-free, via derived data exchange of 3D phenotypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a novel biocompatible gel to improve the effectiveness and safety of thermal tumor ablation procedures. The technology enhances the energy medium of radiofrequency energy, resulting in more effective electroporation of tumors, increasing the therapeutic concentration of energy while minimizing unintended damage to surrounding fluids or tissues. The technological medium aims to improve procedural outcomes for the $800 million and $2.7 billion worldwide image-guided thermal ablation market, with broad applicability for a wide variety of ablation procedures, including those performed for endometrial bleeding, pain management, spinal decompression and denervation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and emphysema reduction.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to develop a novel protein-based gel for improving procedural outcomes during focal tumor ablation procedures. This novel material provides a viscous fluid medium for focusing radiofrequency energy intensity to its intended target area in order to intensify localized energy delivery.  During the first phase, a computational model will be developed using 3D microwave imaging under simulated clinical conditions to predict the thermal behavior of the gel.  During the second phase, preclinical data will be collected using liver, kidney, and muscle tissue in vivo preclinical models and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify temperatures, ablation zone size, and thermal energy deposition. During the third stage, the gel’s effects during tissue ablation will be assessed using in vivo porcine lung and standard non-invasive clinical imaging methods. During the fourth phase, an in vivo chronic safety study will be completed. Upon completion, the results from these milestones will provide the necessary preclinical evidence to initiate first in human studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project specifically seeks to use stable oxygen isotopes (δ18O) measured in cellulose from the annual growth rings of trees located in Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile to reconstruct wet season precipitation variability for at least the last 200 years across the neotropics to glean insights on large-scale tropical climate dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe general goal of the research is to understand recent and potential future changes in the position and width of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and how these changes may be tied to global modes of climate variability and could affect patterns of tropical rainfall in both the northern (NH) and southern (SH) hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe rational for the research strategy of using isotopes from tree cellulose is that the relative paucity of tree-ring records in tropical regions (a large geographic area and extensive ecosystem) prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the range of climate variability particularly at decadal to centennial time scales and in response to changes in radiative forcing. Such data are otherwise unavailable from modern observations, pilot studies, and paleoclimate data elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include support for a postdoctoral researcher as well as graduate undergraduate students involved in the research and extensive interaction with international researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is a new ultra low-cost carbon-oxygen battery that provides high energy density long-duration storage with unique fundamental properties needed to enable 100% renewable energy. This closed-loop stationary energy storage system will turn intermittent solar/wind power into on-demand power at lower cost than fossil fuel generation. Additionally, its high energy density (3x lighter and smaller than Lithium-ion batteries at system level) will enable longer range electric ships, trucks, etc. – a secondary target market – and a much more compact size for stationary storage than other batteries at the same energy capacity. The project will provide insight into the scale-up potential and design parameters of key battery components. Achieving 100% sustainable energy will have a wide range of societal impacts including minimizing environmental impact and improving human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project for the carbon-oxygen battery will thus focus on key technology development of the core components by modeling, building, and testing. This will involve assembling an array of small-scale prototype reactors to screen configurations and iterate on the design, followed by scale up to a larger megawatt-hour (MWh) scale reactors to integrate into a demo system.  The objectives of the Phase II project will focus on optimizing the reactor to achieve the key target metrics, including objectives to: 1) create and validate a multi-physics model of the optimized reactor, 2) design the optimized reactor, operating conditions, and materials, and 3) build and test several optimized reactors and show that the best design has the potential to fulfill the target metrics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nThis projects aims to describe the properties of so-called nematic phases in a variety of materials. The defining feature of nematic phases is orientational order in that the individual molecules are generally aligned along the same direction, yet their location is disordered. As a consequence, these materials flow like a normal fluid, yet they display solid like features when forces affect their orientational order. Such a hybrid nature is key to recent applications in flow control, material shape design and engineering, even actuation and soft robotics induced by light. More widely, a number of biological tissues exhibit the same properties in that oriented individual cells respond as a nematic phase, and such a response is involved in biological function. Theories to be developed in this project will describe the properties and response of those nematic materials that are comprised of complex molecular units, such a long organic molecules, stacks of individual disks in solution, or aggregates of living cells. The theory will pay special attention to defects in nematic phases. These are small regions in which the orientational order is broken, and that are known to determine the characteristic properties of the material. Such an observation lies at the center of recent efforts in the so-called defect engineering field, which seeks not to eliminate defects, but rather to produce them and to control their location and motion in order to produce material properties that would be unachievable in ideal materials without defects. A theoretical understanding of defects, their interactions, and their motion is central to enable further advances in defect engineering and the many applications that are currently being explored involving nematic phases.\r\n\r\nOn the educational side, the project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students, the latter through Summer internships and Honors Thesis projects. In addition, the PI has created and is teaching a new senior undergraduate course PHYS 4041, “Computational Methods in the Physical Sciences'' which is taken by students in Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering. The course involves semester long computational projects, many of which are drawn from examples of the research in this project. As the research proposed overlaps with Physics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Computational Science, there are many opportunities to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, including Honors projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nThis project addresses morphology, topological defects, and nonequilibrium transport in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals, both theoretically and through large scale computation. This material is studied in its nematic phase which displays long range orientational order with characteristic elastic response and defected textures. The research is motivated by recent developments in experimental diagnostics that give, for the first time, access to quantitative detail in the sub-micron range near topological singularities of the nematic director field, as well as related determinations of the material's elastic constants and rheology. These developments open the door to quantitative theories of liquid crystals with complex molecular architectures, extension to many realistic natural systems of the well-known small molecule and isotropic limits. This is necessary as nematic response is under active scrutiny in applications of active and biological matter that display nematic order.\r\n\r\nA self-consistent field theory is proposed to determine free energies of elastically anisotropic nematics. Phenomenological gradient expansions as in, for example, the Landau-de Gennes theory, lead to unbounded energies to the lowest order necessary to incorporate anisotropy. The functional space to the next order that is necessary to restore boundedness is too large to make the theory viable or useful. A computational implementation of a singular potential method has been introduced as an alternative. It has been validated with experimental determinations of singularity profiles in lyotropic chromonics, as well as with equilibrium morphologies of two phase tactoids. This method will be extended into a field theory that can accommodate two distinct features of chromonics: the microscopic units are charged aggregates, and of length that can change depending on distortion. Novel behavior is expected because the complexity of the interactions in lyotropics manifests itself in very small twist elastic constants, leading to novel modes of disclination interactions in three dimensions, to the appearance of configurations with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and even to propagating localized structures. The analysis will be fully three-dimensional and framed within a newly introduced topological invariant for uniaxial phases and an exact kinematic law for the motion of disclinations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical Abstract: The ability of a solid to conduct electricity and heat determines its application potential in new technologies such as microelectronics. Surprisingly, quantum physics predicts that the electricity- and heat- carrying capabilities of a solid at the nanometer scale do not reduce continuously with decreased cross-section. This quantum theory has been validated repeatedly in different experiments for both the electricity- and heat-carrying capabilities of electrons in different nanostructures. In comparison, there has been only one reported experimental observation of the predicted quantum behavior of the heat-carrying ability in a polycrystalline silicon nitride nanostructure. In response to a call for further experimental investigations of the quantum theory of lattice heat transport, this project is focused on experimental investigation of this quantum theory in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a unique measurement method. Success of this research is expected to both enhance the understanding of a essential pillar of condensed matter physics and provide education and outreach opportunities for broadening the participation in quantum and thermal science research and technology developments.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Free of two-level defects, SWCNTs are closest to an ideal one-dimensional (1D) quantum system among the nanostructures that have been experimentally realized. The goal of this work is to advance multiprobe measurements of the intrinsic thermal conductance of 1D nanostructures for accurate detection of the quantized phonon conductance that has been predicted for a SWCNT at a relatively high temperature up to about 10 K. This temperature range is much more conducive to producing unambiguous experimental evidence of quantized phonon conductance than the below-0.8 K temperature required for prior studies of silicon nitride nanobeams. If successful, the proposed measurements of SWCNTs will establish an experimental capability for detecting and controlling quantized phonon transport behaviors of low-dimensional systems. This capability is expected to advance the frontier of experimental research in a foundational area of condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education designed to advance understanding of materials that conduct electricity but contain electrons that apply strong forces on each other which led to new states of electronic matter. These quantum materials have novel properties. The PI will use model calculations for electrons in materials classes known as cuprates and iron-based superconductors, as well as others, to study several challenging problems directed towards a broader understanding of how these materials work. He will also work with a local science museum to prepare exhibits on superconductivity and magnetism for the public, and organize events designed to encourage young women students and researchers to consider a career in physics.\r\n\r\nSuperconductivity is the quantum state of many electrons in a metal that is characterized by the loss of all electrical resistance and consequently of all dissipation of energy. The PI will explore the interplay between the fundamental physics of superconductors and other phases of matter, including magnetic ones, which tend to form when superconductivity is suppressed. In addition, he will explore the effect of chemical impurities, where an atom in a crystal is replaced by a different element, as well as effects of other defects always present when crystals or films are grown. In particular, how these impurities determine the phases that are realized will be addressed.  For example, “islands” or droplets of a secondary phase may appear in the dominant phase of a superconductor. Thus, the PI will explore models of the effect of impurities and other real-life defects on the properties of these superconducting materials. The PI will focus especially on the theory of how to interpret results from scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. This technique reveals atomic-resolution images of the quantum states of a material by applying a voltage to a tiny sharp metal tip as it is scanned over the material's surface - effectively taking an atomic-scale “photograph” of the quantum state. Information obtained from theoretical calculations and the analysis of data from these experiments may provide key insights into the interplay of superconductivity and other quantum states including magnetism and a novel “electronic nematic” state of electrons that is a quantum mechanical analog of states that make liquid crystal displays possible.  One consequence of these investigations may be a deeper insight into the nature of high temperature superconductivity and how it can be further optimized, which could have technological implications.  Understanding the properties of these quantum materials and the influence of disorder may also lead to novel properties that can be utilized in new devices and technologies, such as sensors with unusual sensitivity operating near boundaries among competing phases in highly correlated metals.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to address long-standing fundamental problems involving the interplay of quenched disorder and various types of competing emergent order in correlated electron systems. The materials to be investigated include cuprate and iron-based superconductors, as well as other quantum materials displaying competing orders. The PI will study properties of electronic systems through a careful analysis of the behavior of simplified models of interacting electrons on the lattice, informed in some cases by density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations with appropriate inclusion of correlations. There are three main projects:\r\n\r\n1.  Effects of disorder on overdoped cuprates. The PI will perform a series of investigations on the cuprate materials that can be doped well past optimal doping, to illustrate the unexpected effects of scattering from out-of-plane dopants, and test the materials-specific theory of impurity scattering developed using Wannier function-derived scattering potentials from DFT. The PI and his group will develop materials-specific impurity potentials to understand normal- and superconducting-state transport where forward scattering from impurities can be important, in particular the angle-dependent elastic mean free path observed in resistivity measurements, as well as Terahertz conductivity.    Some of this work will be done in collaboration with a group at Simon Fraser University.  \r\n  Even in the overdoped cuprates, there  is a substantial discrepancy between the resistive Tc and the T where the gap closes.  The team will try to calculate how much of the gap filling phenomenon is due to disorder-induced inhomogeneity near the transition, that is, when the system breaks up into small islands of good superconductor that are weakly proximity coupled.  These phenomenological studies will be supplemented by microscopic studies of spin fluctuation theory, where the doping dependence of the intrinsic pairing interaction is Hubbard-type and modified by disorder, to study the disappearance of Tc on the overdoped side.\r\n\r\n2. STM of charge and pair density waves. Much of the physical information available on competing order and inhomogeneity arises from scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy on high quality surfaces; yet the theory to interpret such data is available only in very primitive form. The PI will use microscopic Wannier functions from ab initio calculations to construct local Green's functions in both superconducting and metallic states to compare with experiments on charge and pair density waves, calculating the local density of states above the sample surface where measurements are actually performed.  In particular, the PI will develop the theory of scanning Josephson spectroscopy to calculate the local critical current using the Wannier function continuum representation, in both the coherent and diffusive regimes to compare with Josephson STM experiments currently being performed.  Understanding the properties of correlated electron systems and the influence of disorder may lead to novel materials properties that can be utilized in new devices and technologies, obtaining unusual sensitivity by operating near transitions between competing phases that occur in highly correlated electron systems.\r\n\r\n3.  Thermal transport and penetration depth in uranium ditelluride with elastic scattering. The spin-triplet heavy fermion superconductor uranium ditelluride is still quite mysterious and the structure of the superconducting gaps are unknown.  Thermal conductivity experiments suggest point nodes, while penetration depth experiments imply that the nodes may be distributed away from high symmetry points.  The PI will develop the theory of both experimental probes for triplet states to settle these issues, including nonunitary ones proposed to explain Kerr effect and muon spin resonance indications of time reversal symmetry breaking.   He will further investigate the role of disorder in producing these signals.  \r\n\r\nThis award also supports outreach activities including: designing a new exhibit on electrical conduction and superconductivity for the recently opened Cade Museum for Innovation, organizing U. Florida Activities in support of United Nations Women and Girls in Science Day, and developing and delivering public lectures. Software developed for the calculation of spin fluctuation pairing, and a database for Wannier functions in unconventional superconductors, will be made available through the PI's website and GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel, surgically implanted device for treating female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Nearly 50% of women in the U.S. will suffer from stress urinary incontinence with age resulting in over 40 million suffering women by 2050. No pharmacological solutions currently exist and mesh-based midurethral slings (MUS) are the mainstay surgical option, even though they are associated with various long-term complications, challenges, and risks. Furthermore, all SUI repair products on the market are polypropylene mesh-based with no alternatives available. This project aims to address this gap in options with a mesh-free, sling-free, outpatient transvaginal repair device for female urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and validate a novel, transvaginal surgical procedural technology for treating stress urinary incontinence. This project progresses findings from the SBIR Phase I project which demonstrated functional proof-of-concept biomechanical feasibility. This Phase II project aims to further the surgical procedure and system in a manner suitable for human use. The scope of technical activities includes design optimization, mechanical testing and validation, surgical procedure validation, biocompatibility testing, and histological characterization in a series of benchtop, cadaveric, and animal studies. The scope of the activities will be conducted in accordance with practices needed to demonstrate chronic implanted safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models in order to gain eventual U.S. regulatory approval.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the first fully implantable, subcutaneous system for treating 200,000 infants born with congenital conditions causing impaired growth of the skull or mandible. These abnormalities affect basic functions including breathing, hearing, speech, visual function, neurologic development, and mastication. Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) is a widely recognized clinical treatment for craniofacial abnormalities that applies controlled mechanical forces to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects by leveraging the natural ability of the body to regenerate bone. Current semi-externalized mechanical design systems restore functional discrepancies but result in issues with patient comfort and adverse events that rely on caregivers to follow precise treatment protocols that hinder widespread adoption. This project aims to develop the first fully subcutaneous, automated DO system for the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) skeleton. Applications include surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder in the adult population, representing potential markets exceeding $10 billion.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a novel, fully implantable craniofacial distraction system comprised of an implantable, magnetically driven mechanism and an external controller driver. The system aims to significantly improve upon existing distraction osteogenesis surgical designs by removing an external component that protrudes through the patient’s skin using a novel implantable magnetic driver design. The novel design enables manual mechanical device adjustment capable of providing the necessary distraction forces in a safe and reliable manner, while eliminating the principal path of complications and treatment noncompliance. The proposed benefits would reduce the risks of infection, device dislodgement, analgesic use, patient stigma, required manual operation, and treatment noncompliance. This project aims to reduce the key critical remaining engineering design risks including system usability issues prior to clinical use and manufacturability. Upon completion of the project, the prototypes will undergo in vivo testing in preclinical models prior to human use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is in the development of a visual unilateral neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation tool for stroke patients.  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability, including the cost of healthcare services, medicines and missed days of work. Stroke related costs in the United States are around $50 billion every year. Unilateral spatial neglect (neglect) is a disabling neurocognitive impairment for stroke patients occurring in 28.60% of the stroke population.  Moreover, neglect is a strong predictor of disability, and stroke patients with neglect have longer hospital stays and receive more direct treatment time from physical and occupational therapists than individuals without neglect, culminating in significantly higher healthcare costs.  However, there is currently no commercial product targeting neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation. Current clinical gold standard neglect detection methods are affected by compensatory strategies and are not sensitive to changes in the severity of neglect; and rehabilitation techniques are not effective in reducing disability associated with neglect.  This project, through a multidisciplinary team, will address these issues while developing the proposed neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation tool that incorporates stimulation to draw attention to the affected side of the body and environment based on the automatic detection of neglect through neurophysiology measured through electroencephalography, thereby stimulating neural networks responsible for spatial attention and perceptual processing for stroke patients. Stimulation during everyday activities with high levels of repetition is needed to promote implicit learning that supports generalization of learning and independence.  Current detection and rehabilitation methods lack the necessary precision, salience, and repetition to promote this type of learning. Due to limitations associated with these methods, there is no gold assessment for neglect or standard of care for rehabilitation of neglect in routine clinical practice. The proposed project offers a potential solution to these problems, incorporating best practices from rehabilitation intervention research and state-of-the-art technologies that will be cost-effective to be implemented in rehabilitation clinics. The proposed technology incorporates objective and reliable quantification of neglect severity and tailored sensory stimulation that is: (i) technology-driven (accurate, reliable, repetitive, cost-effective); (ii) multimodal: visual, auditory, haptic stimulation (optimizes perceptual processing); (iii) individualized to the available field of vision; and (iv) simultaneous with ``real-world'' activities of daily living .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) project provides a high-quality, publicly available data resource for the empirical study of international conflict. The data include all international interactions, by any state in any location, short of war but where the state has intentionally involved or invoked the military by way of threat, show, or use of force against another state. This project, MID6, will update coverage through 2024 and standardize data collection methods for future updates. It will also create MID-Live for the early release of candidate data and for near real-time incident detection. MID6 is critical for all organizations and individuals concerned with national security in general, and militarized interactions between states in particular. It will provide interested parties with the opportunity to develop an analytical understanding of when national security incidents are likely to escalate to military force or are likely to be managed short of this point. It will provide information on evolving patterns of conflict and competition between nation-states, as well as opportunities for cooperation. In essence, MID6 will advance our understanding of the conditions under which conflict, cooperation, and competition are more likely to occur. This project will also bring societal benefits through a focus on providing research experience for students from historically excluded and minoritized backgrounds, as well as cadets from the U.S. Air Force Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data are a primary resource for the study of international conflict and are regularly used in the field of international relations. The current data have coverage from 1816 to 2014. This effort, MID6, will update coverage through 2024, providing an additional ten years of data on militarized interstate incidents and disputes involving any country in any location. It will incorporate research with new tools and technological innovations, specifically in the areas of natural language processing, promote graduate student training, and provide extensive research experience for undergraduates including cadets and members of historically excluded and minoritized populations. It will standardize data collection procedures for ongoing updates beyond 2024 and will provide the highest levels of transparency and accessibility in the data collection process. This project will also create MID-Live for the early release of candidate data and for near real-time incident detection. Through official project channels, for example social media accounts and the MID website hosted by the Correlates of War project, it will identify and publicize MID incidents as they occur. By releasing data faster, MID-Live will improve input data to forecasting models and conflict monitoring systems, as well as provide analysts objective data on conflicts as they occur. Overall, the expansion of the MID data through 2024 and the new innovations ensure that researchers and analysts have the data they need to study and understand international conflict.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance clinical methods that address the extensive physiological variation that is age- and race-dependent. Well-publicized over the last few decades is the lack of healthcare solutions for diseases in preemie babies, who are born to mothers with significant socioeconomic inequalities. Case in point, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and often fatal gastrointestinal, or gut, emergency in premature infants that disproportionately affects African American babies. The disease has not only confounded doctors and nurses for 200 years, but also these neonatal emergencies are also frightening to almost all preemie care providers due to its high mortality rate.  Its healthcare in the US requires $3 billion annually due to repeated x-ray testing, surgery, longer hospital stays, and long-term complications of its survivors. An early and accurate diagnostic test for NEC would be a disruptive paradigm shift in preemie intensive care: it would enable medical intervention to be more effective, reduce risk of disease progression, decrease medical care expenses by hundreds of millions annually, and lower mortality.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop requisite reagents for a diagnostic test that will enable detection of infant proteins that play a role in gut health.  Absolute quantitation is a prerequisite for data interpretation and validation between experiments, laboratories, and testing platforms. Research objectives are directed toward critical technical hurdles: (1) determination of optimal reference standard to quantitate host biomolecules in clinical settings and (2) understanding the usage limitations of these reference standards in the background of high variation in the human population. Native and recombinant candidates will be compared and analyzed with various methods.  Anticipated results are reference standards that are age-specific for diagnostic use in the most fragile and smallest patients and that are acceptable to regulatory stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel device which reduces injury to patients by emergency personnel when using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) manual resuscitator. BVMs are used in pre-hospital and hospital settings by emergency medical personnel on a daily basis to deliver air to critically ill patients. Their basic design has been in place for over 60 years and are often misused resulting in damage, complications, or occasionally fatal lung injury. This project will complete development of a novel BVM that precisely controls the volumes and pressures delivered, and aims to redefine the stagnant BVM market which is projected to surpass $750M annually by 2025.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, adjustable, universal bag-valve-mask resuscitator enabling emergency providers to deliver air volumes and pressures customized to patient body size. Current devices are commonly misused, even by highly trained medical personnel, resulting in hyperventilation, barotrauma, and occasional death. The project will complete remaining design and testing tasks, and a human factors proof of concept study to demonstrate users are able to quickly and properly utilize the device with minimal instruction will be performed. The second objective will address manufacturability and testing requirements within standards for US approval. Finally, the third objective is to establish the assembly processes and initial quality control testing to ensure consistent manufacturing at scale and in a cost effective and quality consistent manner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Barrier-island communities face flooding due to rising sea levels and stronger storms, and typical adaptations (protect, accommodate, retreat) may not keep up with increasing risks. Communities are now considering extreme adaptations, such as allowing an island section to ‘return to nature’ by removing roadways and other infrastructure. But these extreme adaptations transform the natural processes of and the community’s relationship with barriers. The effects on flood risks at nearby communities are not well understood, and it is not clear whether communities will ‘welcome the water’ or reject it as opposing their sense of place. This Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project explores participatory transformation of barriers. Stakeholders will provide insights on place meanings across the barrier island and how floods affect these places and their connections to the community. The project also quantifies how flooding at a natural island section may change the hazard at neighboring communities, and whether these locations can be selected to minimize the risks while maximizing community attachments. These activities provide a framework for participatory transformation, as well as advance technologies for flood risk modeling that can be expanded to improve disaster resilience for communities along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts. This research also supports an immersive experience for students to collaborate across engineering and social-science disciplines to tackle the challenges of climate change.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project advances understanding of how local erosion events contribute to floods at neighboring communities; how these floods can be managed by allowing barrier sections to return to nature; and how such a transformation, when informed and deliberated by community stakeholders, may affect community place meanings. The research will be organized on the following objectives: (O1) identify ‘acceptable’ locations for extreme adaptation of barrier systems; (O2) quantify reductions in flood risk from extreme adaptations at ‘acceptable’ and other locations; and (O3) assess changes in stakeholders’ perceptions about extreme adaptation techniques for barrier islands. Via high-resolution modeling of flooding subject to possible barrier configurations and future climate scenarios, this project quantifies the scales of flooding at neighboring communities. And via science co-production, this project investigates how the community’s attachment to the barrier island may be increased if stakeholders take an active role in the transformation. This project uses transformative research approaches and engagement to facilitate new approaches to community-led management and adaptation of barriers, enable improved efforts to plan for the consequences of landform changes and development, and advance the integration of the coastal science, engineering, and adaptation disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Damaging thunderstorm-wind events in the US outnumber those of tornadoes by an order of magnitude, with greater cumulative losses. Most notably, the August 2020 derecho event in the Midwest US was the costliest thunderstorm event in US history at over $13Billion in losses. Critical questions regarding the mechanisms for such extreme wind generation remain unanswered, partly because, relative to tornadoes, thunderstorm winds have been understudied both by meteorologists and engineers. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will examine how characteristics of thunderstorm winds, including design-level peak wind speeds, relate to the different generating mechanisms of such winds. The project will also investigate spatial variabilities and temporal intermittencies associated with these mechanisms, which will contribute to the fundamental understanding of thunderstorm-wind generation and the variability observed in the field. The underlying focus of the project on hazardous thunderstorms will ultimately lead to better forecasts and warnings of thunderstorm-wind events, and to integration of the findings into building codes and standards. In addition, the project will train a new generation of interdisciplinary engineers and scientists who appreciate both the basic scientific problem, and the engineering solutions.\r\n\r\nConceptual wind-damage models, especially for engineering, have focused on the “downburst” as being responsible for all extreme winds near the surface. However, there are other mechanisms for thunderstorm wind generation including the rear-inflow jet (RIJ) and mesovortices, which may be responsible for a significant proportion of damage from thunderstorms. RIJ-induced winds are suspected in the August 2020 derecho based on early results from numerical simulations.  This project will examine alternative forcing mechanisms by combining existing observational data from the August 2020 derecho and other high-impact events, with post-event damage surveys, and to-be-developed high-resolution numerical simulations of convective-storm events. Three major research tasks will tease out the different mechanisms: (1) Numerical simulations of specific events, with resolution sufficient for determination of the wind-generation mechanism and associated forcings and reduced-complexity dynamical modeling to relate the wind forcings to the detailed characteristics of the thunderstorm winds. (2) Wind engineering analysis, which will match/compare the modeling results of specific events to existing thunderstorm wind data and post-event damage data as well as an analysis of the data generated from the higher resolution numerical models. This analysis will include four-dimensional assessment of engineering-relevant characteristics such as peak wind speed, wind speed profiles, and comparisons to existing engineering models of thunderstorm winds. (3) Climatological analysis of thunderstorm winds in the US, with specific interest in sub-classifying these winds by their generation mechanism (RIJ, downburst, mesovortex). Each mechanism will be assessed for their importance in wind loading of structures through the engineering characteristics in (2). This will connect the results from (1) and (2).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "A seismic event often involves multiple hazards (e.g., ground shaking, landslide, and liquefaction) and impacts (e.g., building and infrastructure damage). Understanding the locations and extents of such hazards and impacts in high resolution immediately after an event is critical for facilitating real-time responses, such as timely evacuation, search and rescue, and effective allocations of limited resources.  Researchers have been investigating using satellite imageries to extract hazard and impact information for wide affected areas; however, the co-occurrence and co-location of hazards and impacts result in mixed signals in satellite imagery, making it very challenging to directly categorize and estimate each hazard and associated impacts. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project aims to develop a novel system to provide rapid, scalable, and joint assessments of cascading seismic hazards and impacts by leveraging the causal dependencies among them. It will enhance the accuracy, resolution, and timeliness of existing rapid disaster information systems by integrating satellite images with existing geospatial hazard models from The US Geological Survey and building fragility functions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s HAZUS tool. The revealed regional causal mechanisms aims to enable improved seismic risk analysis as well as the study of other natural disasters involving cascading impacts. This will improve overall community resilience to future natural disasters.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a causality-informed variational Bayesian network modeling framework to adaptively provide regional-scale seismic multi-hazard and impact occurrence estimates in near-real-time, by fusing information from satellite images with prior geophysical knowledge and building fragility functions through a deep causal Bayesian network. First, a novel paradigm will be established to model complex and implicit causal dependencies among cascading seismic multi-hazards and impacts as a flow-based causal Bayesian network to integrate information from prior hazards and impact models with mixed-signal satellite imagery. Further, an online variational Bayesian inference framework will be developed to jointly infer and update, in a scalable and efficient manner, the estimations of seismic multi-hazards and impacts, with or without partially observed ground truth. Third, local geospatial hazards model and building fragility functions will be updated through a novel uncertainty-aware prior model updating scheme using the event-specific patterns learned from the causal Bayesian network. The quantitative causal mechanisms of cascading seismic hazards and building damage, revealed by the causal Bayesian network, will be characterized in multiple earthquake events, to render an in-depth understanding of event-specific seismic hazards and damage patterns for improving regional resilience to future disaster events. The framework will be demonstrated on seven moderate-to-large global earthquake events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In reinforced concrete buildings, cast-in-place floor slabs, or “diaphragms”, must resist both gravity loads, the weight of the structure and building contents, and horizontal loads, caused by wind or the inertia of the floors during earthquakes. For the building to function, these floor diaphragms also must contain openings for stairs, elevators, and mechanical systems. Although the presence of these openings is accounted for when designing the structure for gravity loads, there is little research or understanding of how they affect the building’s behavior during earthquake loading. The potential consequences of this lack of understanding were recently demonstrated during earthquake simulator tests on a five-story reinforced concrete building. Unexpected diaphragm damage during testing indicates that openings adjacent to walls and columns contribute to collapse risk and could preclude or delay the return of a building’s functionality after a seismic event. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings and develop tools for their design and for probabilistically quantifying their expected performance during an earthquake. The research will be complemented by an online class curriculum focusing on accurate simulation approaches and their validation, for both students and practitioners, as part of the recently established earthquake engineering certificate program and outreach to engage underrepresented minority and first-generation college students in research.\r\n\r\nThis award will focus on advancing science-based tools and technologies, through simulation-driven experimental testing and nonlinear finite element analysis of prototype buildings under multiple hazard intensities, for the collapse-resistant and recovery-based earthquake engineering of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings. This research will investigate (1) accurate load paths, including fanned collection patterns from regions of low stress to struts, which form the primary load path; (2) the impact of openings and establishing protected zones to mitigate damage that could lead to partial collapse; and (3) damage states and fragility curves that quantify diaphragm performance for inclusion in functional recovery methodologies. Several fundamental research questions will be answered, including (1) what is the inertial load path through the diaphragm, and how are these load paths affected by openings; (2) how does the slab thickness, reinforcement, and the presence of openings affect the capacity of diaphragm elements subjected to complex in-plane stresses; (3) how does the presence of openings modify the effective stiffness of diaphragms, and what is the effect on engineering demand parameters; (4) what is the relationship between engineering demand parameters, ground motion intensity measures, and diaphragm damage; and (5) how does diaphragm damage around openings affect safety, story access, and tenet functionality. Equally important, this project will form the foundation for additional research to fully investigate the lateral force resisting system, including slab-wall and slab-column connections, using pseudo-dynamic and earthquake simulator testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Wildfires can have detrimental effects on the safety, economy, and well-being of affected communities with the risk borne disproportionately by disadvantaged communities. A critical factor that can prevent wildfires from turning into a human disaster is “access,” which refers to the ease of reaching shelters and is the product of both mobility and location of shelters. Despite its crucial importance, the state-of-the-art solutions and practices currently lack a systematic framework that determines access during wildfire events while incorporating equity considerations. The overarching goal of this Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project is to incorporate equity into wildfire preparedness strategies and minimize the equity of access gap to resources between disadvantaged and advantaged communities. The adverse effects of wildfires can be mitigated if a community understands its existing vulnerabilities and adapts strategic preparedness plans before a disaster to build resilience. Wildfire preparedness strategies, however, must be formulated and implemented through the lens of equity and justice. For example, for residents who do not have access to transportation, a simple task like locating and driving to an American Red Cross shelter is not feasible.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project develops a science-informed community-based solution for disadvantaged communities to augment equity discrepancies and community resilience to the devasting impacts of the ongoing challenge for residents of wildfire-prone areas. It fulfills three objectives: (i) it quantifies disparities in shelter access between disadvantaged and advantaged communities, (ii) it optimizes access-related equity through short- and long-term wildfire preparedness strategies, and (iii) it develops a science-based community-centered interactive strategic planning platform for public officials and community members. This is exercised in close collaboration with our community partners in Lake County, California, where 60% of the land has burned between 2015 and 2020, possesses key characteristics of an at-risk community, and is home to a significant population of underserved residents, including indigenous people. The potential benefit to society from the researched project is improving the resilience of disadvantaged communities and equipping the community, emergency management, and emergency responders with the knowledge and science-based tools required to make informed decisions and decrease the escapable repercussions on disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "To promote community resilience and equity, this Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project examines a series of place-based, human-centered networks, leveraging micromobility (lightweight vehicles such as bicycles or scooters), community social ties, and resilience hubs, to better meet those impacted by a disaster after the event. In particular, the project investigates the potential role of social networks and micromobility in enhancing the planning and operation of resilience hubs, an emerging infrastructural concept that has the potential to support more equitable disaster response and recovery efforts. The project investigates opportunities and challenges regarding enhancing resilience in two study locations: a metropolitan coastal city and an inland suburban community where the results can inform more equitable transportation operational strategies and preparedness measures for other highly vulnerable regions of the United States. The results of this research can extend the state of knowledge about how micromobility resilience hubs can support social network connectivity, increase community cohesion and capacity, and enhance community and national resilience. Communities and people are at the center of the research, learning from stakeholder expertise and experiences to adapt the resilience hub concept to meet the needs of future resilient cities.\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to understand how micromobility infrastructure and community social networks can be effectively leveraged in disaster response. Using human-centered data and mixed-method analyses, this Disaster Resilience Research Grant project combines social network analysis, qualitative thematic analysis, discrete choice modeling, and agent-based simulations, to model a cohesive network for disaster-prone communities addressing the vulnerabilities of individuals and the community. The objectives of this project are to 1) understand the functions, usage, and applicability of micromobility in different disaster scenarios; 2) understand how micromobility systems and local social networks can be integrated to better support communities in both every day and disaster scenarios; and 3) validate the applicability of micromobility resilience hubs as connection points for micromobility and social networks in a range of communities and disaster types via the empirical analysis and synthesis of findings from focus groups, surveys, interviews, simulations, and on-the-ground field tests co-designed with community partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Immediately after a major hazard event (e.g., wildfire, earthquake, flood), a prompt assessment of the geographic distribution and severity of infrastructure damage is vital to the success of the emergency response and early recovery planning. This situational awareness is an important part of the decision-making processes that are implemented by facility owners, users, emergency responders and local and state officials. Conversely, a general lack of knowledge about the impacted state of the built environment can lead to a disorganized public response and slower recovery. While a comprehensive assessment of the extent and distribution of infrastructure damage can be obtained from in-person inspections conducted by building professionals, depending on the scale of the event, this can be a lengthy, resource intensive process. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will address this challenge by utilizing principles from artificial intelligence (AI) to develop near real-time infrastructure damage prediction models that can process and utilize different types of data and information (e.g., images, text, tabular data). By advancing our ability to effectively integrate disparate information sources, this project aims to transform the way that physical damage to infrastructure is estimated in the aftermath of a major disaster event, thereby enhancing the emergency response and recovery planning phases that follow. The research will provide training for doctoral and masters students and an opportunity to teach undergraduates from different backgrounds how science and engineering coupled with AI technologies can be used to improve community response to extreme events.\r\n\r\nFundamental concepts and methodological advancements in multimodal learning will be used to transform and enhance infrastructure damage prediction models for use in the immediate post-event environment. The state-of-the-art in image-based damage assessment will be advanced along two dimensions: (1) developing Vision Transformer-based methods and (2) establishing a self-supervised learning methodology for training the models using large collections of unlabeled data. A new knowledge base will be established around the broad area of multimodal data fusion for infrastructure damage prediction models. Specific questions regarding unified representation, translation across and alignment between modalities and data fusion will be answered. A new type of hazard-agnostic infrastructure damage prediction model will also emerge from this research. Such a model will have the ability to receive an integrated representation of one or more types of input modalities (i.e., image, text, and engineering/tabular data) and produce, as output, an infrastructure damage level that is agnostic to the type of causal event (e.g., earthquake or hurricane). Using a comprehensive data set from multiple natural hazard events (hurricane and earthquake), the project will include experiments to shed new light on the ability of both hazard-specific and hazard-agnostic multimodal models to enhance early-stage infrastructure damage assessments for increased situational awareness and enhanced resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Geoscience as a profession is at a crossroads with respect to attracting individuals from diverse populations and training future geoscientists. Western Oregon University (WOU) will develop a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem, which is a collaborative partnership between a four-year public university, natural resource focused government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and regional geoscience employers. The goal of the partnership is to cultivate Earth science literacy and motivate novel solutions to local environmental issues, while connecting diverse student populations to the geoscience discipline with altruistic motivations for pursuing future careers as professionals. The project will engage and invigorate a new generation of geoscience professionals, particularly those who have been structurally excluded in the sciences. Existing elements of WOU’s Earth and Environmental Science program will be strengthened with the intentional cultivation of an enhanced Geo-STEM learning ecosystem that provides professional mentorship and career-outreach experiences, designed to increase awareness of opportunities for professional outcomes in early career undergraduates who otherwise lack access. \r\n\r\nThe overarching project goal is to strengthen a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem and engage more young people in geosciences at the undergraduate level. The project will focus on mentored geoscience education through development of community water resource partnerships. Given that water resources and river restoration are iconic scientific themes in the Pacific Northwest, the WOU GEOPAths project team has adapted fundamental concepts of floodplain connectivity to the Geo-STEM learning ecosystem model, with the analogous intent of increasing connections between early career undergraduates to the geoscience profession. Specific objectives include: (1) increasing enrollment, diversity, and retention in the geosciences; (2) strengthening the statewide Geo-STEM learning ecosystem by fortifying connections to the professional community; and (3) testing novel approaches to recruitment of diverse populations in the geoscience profession. Extra-curricular experiences and training in the geosciences with a focus on service-learning and workforce training will lead to increased probabilities for student engagement, academic success, and positive career outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The global population has skyrocketed from approximately one billion in 1800 to over eight billion in 2024, driving increased demand for vital and interrelated resources like energy, food, and water. Sustainable approaches are required to meet the escalating energy demand, including resource conservation, energy storage enhancements, and global energy resource management. Addressing the research challenges associated with providing clean energy for the world is a multidisciplinary problem that requires scientists and engineers from diverse fields to collaborate closely. However, the current academic research on sustainable energy is primarily concentrated within traditional academic disciplines. Consequently, academic programs may fail to train graduate students who will enter the energy sector workforce with the essential communication skills and technical expertise to confront these profoundly interdisciplinary challenges. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Boston University (BU) will create an interdisciplinary community of students trained to work collaboratively on sustainable energy research and development. The ENERGIZE project anticipates training 100-125 Ph.D. and master’s students, including 20 funded trainees from a diverse range of disciplines across the university. Trainees will come primarily, but not exclusively, from Ph.D. programs.\r\n\r\nThe technical focus of the ENERGIZE NRT spans research in photochemical conversion, electrochemical conversion, electrochemical storage, and photochemical storage while concurrently providing foundational training for students in physical and computational experimentation and data science. The program has five integrated components: (i) evidence-based experiential learning and interdisciplinary collaborations, (ii) building communications and leadership skills, (iii) career development, (iv) interdisciplinary mentoring, and (v) rigorous program assessment to track learning outcomes. Trainees will develop depth in a particular area of study and breadth across complementary areas of energy conversion, energy storage, sustainability, and data science through coursework, workshops, an internship-based practicum, and mentored laboratory research projects. They will engage in formal activities devoted to professional development, career planning, and skills acquisition through bootcamps, tailored workshops, and leadership opportunities within the NRT community. The project outcomes will include a model for educating scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary research, a research community with technical depth and breadth and a broad understanding of the social impact of sustainable energy and their own research, and educational materials and best practices on research education and professional development.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to build a cross-region innovative research group focused on equitable educational innovations to support historically excluded middle and high school youth–Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC), female-identifying youth, and youth in Title I schools or rural underserved districts–to develop embodied pathways to participation in geosciences communities. The key project activity will be the creation of a practitioner research group composed of community stakeholders, teachers, geoscience faculty, and educational community partners. This group will collaborate to develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation pathways for supporting historically excluded youth in geoscience communities of practice through hands-on fieldwork experiences and digital reflections. The stakeholders will form goals, identify success measures, and work to expand their program’s goals through developing a shared understanding around what equitable participation trajectories look like across similar domains.\r\n\r\nThe effects of underserved youth being excluded from the geosciences is readily reflected in the field however, less is known about the experiences of these youth in such trajectories and how geosciences educational stakeholders could redesign pathways to better serve the students. This project will use methods of community design research to 1) develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation in geoscience fieldwork; 2) develop shared best practices for facilitating more equitable participation in geosciences fieldwork and disciplinary conversations; and 3) support network partners in redesigning programs to set and meet expansive goals in this regard. Over the course of the project, the PI team will build a network of geosciences instructors and practitioners and work on iterative cycles of expanding their programmatic goals in alignment with the five key areas for the following outcomes: 1) Grounded fun; 2) STEM capital; 3) STEM trajectories; 4) STEM identity work; and 5) Agency.\r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to serve the national interest by producing more qualified technicians to meet workforce demands in cybersecurity. Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge in business, industry, and government. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect both existing and emerging technologies. This project will prepare students for cybersecurity technician positions by engaging with employers to strengthen the technical experience that students gain during their courses. The project will also focus on increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation of students from underrepresented groups and will thereby improve the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\nBased at Cypress College, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), this project will build on a previous NSF-funded project, called \"PACE: Pathway to Advance Cybersecurity Education\" (NSF Award DUE-1902519), which developed a pathway from high school (as early as 9th grade) with multiple educational and employment exit points. The new project, known as \"ACE IDEAS: Advanced Cybersecurity Education for Industry-driven, Diversity-minded, Early Aged Students,\" has two main goals: (1) update and augment the PACE cybersecurity courses to include project-based learning, internships, soft skills, and focused preparation for industry certification exams and (2) build program enrollment, persistence, and completion through activities with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups. In particular, the investigators will work closely with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) to align the curriculum with the needs of employers, develop internships, and integrate project-based learning. Other activities will include developing an ePortfolio system for students, developing an industry mentorship program for students, engaging high school students in CyberPatriot and other competitions, and offering workshops on inclusive practices to high school teachers and counselors and college faculty. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1.

         "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to investigate the behavior of quantum systems with many particles, such as electrons in a crystalline solid.  The large number of electrons and their inherent quantum mechanical nature can act in concert leading to new states of matter.  Among these are superconductors, which can conduct electricity with zero resistance, and the quantum Hall states, in which a strong magnetic field causes electrons confined to two dimensions to execute tight circular orbits, thereby forcing net electrical current flow to thei edges of the system.  The goal of the PI’s work is to combine tools from theoretical condensed matter and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these states of quantum matter. \r\n\r\nIn the last few years, quantum computing has motivated significant progress in condensed matter theory.  Quantum computing deals with systems that contain many quantum bits, providing a new perspective on the physics of systems of many quantum mechanical particles that is complementary to the traditional one.  The PI will combine new quantum computing inspired methods with standard condensed matter techniques to gain a better understanding of the landscape of condensed matter phases.  One particular benefit of this program is that some of the exotic condensed matter phases studied by the PI may in turn have applications to the design of new quantum computing platforms.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD.  The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics, and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to classify topological quantum phases of matter, including those that are out of equilibrium and those protected by additional symmetries.  The PI will combine ideas from condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, and quantum information theory to gain an understanding of these quantum many-body systems.  Specifically, the PI will connect the topological features of quantum field theories, such as topological terms in continuum effective actions, to topological invariants that can in principle be directly extracted from a lattice Hamiltonian, such as braiding statistics of anyon or defect excitations.  Because a lattice quantum many-body system is essentially a many-qubit system, it is natural that ideas from quantum information theory will naturally be involved in this work.  One quantum information idea is that of a non-trivial quantum cellular automaton, which is a generalization of a shallow-depth circuit of local unitaries.  The PI will explore the utility of using such quantum cellular automatons to disentangle exotic, “beyond-cohomology,” symmetry protected topological phases of matter.\r\n\r\nAn additional tool that the PI plans to use is that of the conformal bootstrap.  This is a numerical technique that constrains the possible conformal field theories that can exist, by putting bounds on their spectra of dimensions of local operators.  Building on preliminary work, the PI's team will research how to constrain the conformal field theories that can exist at the boundaries of topological phases, by incorporating the corresponding 't Hooft anomalies into the conformal bootstrap.  More generally, the aim of the PI will be to determine how to incorporate information about the non-local operators that appear in topological field-theories into the conformal bootstrap.  Furthermore, the PI will also explore topological effects in non-equilibrium settings, such as the recently introduced measurement-induced entanglement transition.  Preliminary work by the PI's team has uncovered, for a certain simple instance of this transition, a dual statistical-mechanics model which exhibits a topological phase transition.  The PI plans to explore more general versions of this duality.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will support and mentor graduate students throughout their progress to a PhD.  The PI will help educate the students in the relevant areas of condensed matter physics and help them develop proper written and oral communication skills to facilitate the dissemination of their research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards (RIA) provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award will help to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Johnson C. Smith University aims to investigate green technology and its application to inhibit bacterial growth. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the phytochemical constituents found within citrus fruits have natural antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The project is designed to engage undergraduate students in fundamental research, as well as strengthen the research-based pedagogical approaches of the Principal Investigator. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the fundamental plasmonic, Green Nanotechnology (e.g., method/route) response of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) interacting with Streptococcus pneumoniae, is critical in combating the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance. The aims of the proposed study are threefold: (i) Determine the antibiotic influence of plant extraction on the proliferation of various S. pneumoniae isolates, (ii) Examine the effect of Green synthesized AgNPs on planktonic growth of S. pneumoniae, and (iii) Determine the cytotoxicity of green synthesized, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel synthesized Ag Nanoparticles on noncancerous, upper respiratory cell lines. In this study, Citrus (Citrus sp.) peel extracts are used as an eco-friendly, reducing and stabilizing agent. The synthesized AgNPs characterization involves using Ultra-violet (UV)-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy, (FTIR), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Zeta Potential, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). While this research addresses alternative approaches to combat bacterial growth against antimicrobial resistant bacteria in a more biological, economical, and eco-friendly manner, the results have the potential to shed light on new knowledge and treatment(s) for medical implants (e.g. catheters, joint prostheses, and pacemakers) and dental implants/orthodontic devices as well as maintenance of pipes/plumbing systems (e.g. biofouling), ship hulls and underwater structures, food processing equipment, and water distribution systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Since its inception, the purpose of the CCC has been to catalyze the development of bold, far-reaching visions for computing research, and to facilitate the communication of those research visions to stakeholders both within and beyond the computing research ecosystem. The CCC fosters proactive engagement with both computing and non-computing research stakeholders -- agencies, industry, professional societies, consortia, and philanthropic stakeholders -- to ensure that it continues to expand its network and impact.\r\n\r\nThe CCC provides the continuity and capacity to bring together stakeholders that depend on computing innovation as part of increasingly diverse and multi-disciplinary national and societal needs. The CCC plays a vital and effective role in catalyzing the computing research community to articulate far reaching and strategic research visions that will continue to shape the field for decades to come. The majority of CCC visioning activities and white papers bring together multidisciplinary expertise and needs that combine to create important disciplinary and interdisciplinary challenges for the computing field. The results of these activities are disseminated back to the community to ensure continued revitalization and advancement of new areas and topics for future computing research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There continues to be increasing demand for more comprehensive assessments of the impacts of STEM education programs, policies, and practices. One stumbling block to such research is the need for large sample sizes for studies to be able to make the intended claims. This research develops, and tests new estimation procedures for cross-classified structural equation models for the statistical analysis of small to moderate sample size studies of teaching and learning in mathematics. These new tools reduce the burden of large sample sizes. The team will develop new shareable software tools (in an open-source software application) and deliver training opportunities to researchers. Further, these estimation models and research tools will have broad impact as they are usable for similar study designs in all STEM content learning settings.\r\n\r\nThis research bridges the gap between current research methods and the scale with which most STEM education studies are conducted. The team will develop new estimation methods for small to moderate sample cross-classified structural equation models that are tightly attuned to the features of teaching and learning research but broadly applicable across areas of STEM education. The research integrates four components. The research study (a) derives a new statistical framework and estimators, (b) develops empirical guidelines for study design with the proposed methods using a rich survey of teaching and learning programs and teacher development processes, (c) develops free and accessible software and tutorials, and (d) conducts highly accessible workshops to improve the capacity of the field. \r\n\r\nThis research project is supported by NSF's STEM EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "General abstract\r\n\r\nMost organisms alternate between life stages that vary in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes, in the number of cells they possess, and in the environmental conditions in which they are best adapted to live. Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc. All team members will contribute by writing for blogs produced by professional societies for the public.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nExisting macroalgal taxa samples from across a latitudinal gradient in the western Antarctic Peninsula will be used to explore patterns of genetic diversity from the center to the southern latitudinal limits of their range. Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research on physical processes to convert solar energy to electricity in organic materials. Solar cells, which absorb sunlight and generate electricity, are playing and will continue to play a strong role in reducing the demand for fossil-fuel derived energy. Solar cells constructed out of organic molecules or polymers are of interest because they are inexpensive, easy to process, lightweight and flexible. The electric power generated by today’s organic solar cells is limited because of thermodynamic constraints. There is currently intense scientific effort to overcome these constraints and to construct solar cells that yield higher power. A promising approach is to use singlet fission, a photophysical process within which the electrical current generated by light absorption is in principle doubled. Practical utilization of singlet fission requires further research. Charge generation here occurs in two steps, and while impressive success has been reached in the development of chromophores in which the first step is very efficient, in nearly all cases the second step takes too long, and electric charge, and so, energy, is lost to the process of recombination. The PI will perform quantum chemical calculations that will lead to new molecular materials in which the second step of singlet fission, charge separation, will occur ultrafast, leading to organic solar cells with higher quantum efficiencies. A significant portion of the research is in collaboration with groups that specialize in experimental research on singlet fission. The broader impacts of this work include interdisciplinary training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, outreach efforts fostering interest in chemistry and physics among members of underserved groups, and increased scientific literacy and public awareness.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the process of singlet fission in organic solar cell materials. Research on singlet fission until recently focused on designing materials that give rapid singlet to triplet-triplet conversion. Rapid triplet-triplet generation; however, is a consequence of strong interchromophore coupling that also leads to strong triplet-triplet multiexciton binding and fast triplet recombination instead of generation of free triplets. Overcoming this impasse requires clear understanding of the relationship between bonding motifs and the generation of triplet-triplet multiexcitons with weak binding energy, that have been discovered recently in different families of intramolecular singlet fission materials. The PI will perform high order multiple reference configuration interaction-calculations within the semiempirical Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian using a diagrammatic exciton basis that will yield precise structure-property correlations with predictive capability. The goal of this research is to arrive at structural features that will give fast generation of free triplets in ultrafast times. The research contributes to fundamental knowledge that underlies solar energy and other technologies, particularly those that could be based on organic materials. Junior researchers involved in this project are gaining experience in state-of-the-art computational methods, including quantum many-body physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Quantitative study of morphology is central to many fields within the biological sciences, as anatomical systems hold important clues on how organism move, feed, reproduce and interact with the environment in which they live in. Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them. The project team will also train hundreds of early career scientists, whose research and teaching will benefit from the easy manipulation and use of digital biological specimens. Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources. Proposed cloud services and analytical tools will also make wider-scale, multi-lab collaborations friction-free, via derived data exchange of 3D phenotypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Quantitative study of morphology is central to many fields within the biological sciences, as anatomical systems hold important clues on how organism move, feed, reproduce and interact with the environment in which they live in. Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them. The project team will also train hundreds of early career scientists, whose research and teaching will benefit from the easy manipulation and use of digital biological specimens. Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources. Proposed cloud services and analytical tools will also make wider-scale, multi-lab collaborations friction-free, via derived data exchange of 3D phenotypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a novel biocompatible gel to improve the effectiveness and safety of thermal tumor ablation procedures. The technology enhances the energy medium of radiofrequency energy, resulting in more effective electroporation of tumors, increasing the therapeutic concentration of energy while minimizing unintended damage to surrounding fluids or tissues. The technological medium aims to improve procedural outcomes for the $800 million and $2.7 billion worldwide image-guided thermal ablation market, with broad applicability for a wide variety of ablation procedures, including those performed for endometrial bleeding, pain management, spinal decompression and denervation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and emphysema reduction.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project aims to develop a novel protein-based gel for improving procedural outcomes during focal tumor ablation procedures. This novel material provides a viscous fluid medium for focusing radiofrequency energy intensity to its intended target area in order to intensify localized energy delivery.  During the first phase, a computational model will be developed using 3D microwave imaging under simulated clinical conditions to predict the thermal behavior of the gel.  During the second phase, preclinical data will be collected using liver, kidney, and muscle tissue in vivo preclinical models and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify temperatures, ablation zone size, and thermal energy deposition. During the third stage, the gel’s effects during tissue ablation will be assessed using in vivo porcine lung and standard non-invasive clinical imaging methods. During the fourth phase, an in vivo chronic safety study will be completed. Upon completion, the results from these milestones will provide the necessary preclinical evidence to initiate first in human studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project specifically seeks to use stable oxygen isotopes (δ18O) measured in cellulose from the annual growth rings of trees located in Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile to reconstruct wet season precipitation variability for at least the last 200 years across the neotropics to glean insights on large-scale tropical climate dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe general goal of the research is to understand recent and potential future changes in the position and width of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and how these changes may be tied to global modes of climate variability and could affect patterns of tropical rainfall in both the northern (NH) and southern (SH) hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe rational for the research strategy of using isotopes from tree cellulose is that the relative paucity of tree-ring records in tropical regions (a large geographic area and extensive ecosystem) prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the range of climate variability particularly at decadal to centennial time scales and in response to changes in radiative forcing. Such data are otherwise unavailable from modern observations, pilot studies, and paleoclimate data elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include support for a postdoctoral researcher as well as graduate undergraduate students involved in the research and extensive interaction with international researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Geoscience as a profession is at a crossroads with respect to attracting individuals from diverse populations and training future geoscientists. Western Oregon University (WOU) will develop a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem, which is a collaborative partnership between a four-year public university, natural resource focused government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and regional geoscience employers. The goal of the partnership is to cultivate Earth science literacy and motivate novel solutions to local environmental issues, while connecting diverse student populations to the geoscience discipline with altruistic motivations for pursuing future careers as professionals. The project will engage and invigorate a new generation of geoscience professionals, particularly those who have been structurally excluded in the sciences. Existing elements of WOU’s Earth and Environmental Science program will be strengthened with the intentional cultivation of an enhanced Geo-STEM learning ecosystem that provides professional mentorship and career-outreach experiences, designed to increase awareness of opportunities for professional outcomes in early career undergraduates who otherwise lack access. \r\n\r\nThe overarching project goal is to strengthen a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem and engage more young people in geosciences at the undergraduate level. The project will focus on mentored geoscience education through development of community water resource partnerships. Given that water resources and river restoration are iconic scientific themes in the Pacific Northwest, the WOU GEOPAths project team has adapted fundamental concepts of floodplain connectivity to the Geo-STEM learning ecosystem model, with the analogous intent of increasing connections between early career undergraduates to the geoscience profession. Specific objectives include: (1) increasing enrollment, diversity, and retention in the geosciences; (2) strengthening the statewide Geo-STEM learning ecosystem by fortifying connections to the professional community; and (3) testing novel approaches to recruitment of diverse populations in the geoscience profession. Extra-curricular experiences and training in the geosciences with a focus on service-learning and workforce training will lead to increased probabilities for student engagement, academic success, and positive career outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to build a cross-region innovative research group focused on equitable educational innovations to support historically excluded middle and high school youth–Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC), female-identifying youth, and youth in Title I schools or rural underserved districts–to develop embodied pathways to participation in geosciences communities. The key project activity will be the creation of a practitioner research group composed of community stakeholders, teachers, geoscience faculty, and educational community partners. This group will collaborate to develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation pathways for supporting historically excluded youth in geoscience communities of practice through hands-on fieldwork experiences and digital reflections. The stakeholders will form goals, identify success measures, and work to expand their program’s goals through developing a shared understanding around what equitable participation trajectories look like across similar domains.\r\n\r\nThe effects of underserved youth being excluded from the geosciences is readily reflected in the field however, less is known about the experiences of these youth in such trajectories and how geosciences educational stakeholders could redesign pathways to better serve the students. This project will use methods of community design research to 1) develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation in geoscience fieldwork; 2) develop shared best practices for facilitating more equitable participation in geosciences fieldwork and disciplinary conversations; and 3) support network partners in redesigning programs to set and meet expansive goals in this regard. Over the course of the project, the PI team will build a network of geosciences instructors and practitioners and work on iterative cycles of expanding their programmatic goals in alignment with the five key areas for the following outcomes: 1) Grounded fun; 2) STEM capital; 3) STEM trajectories; 4) STEM identity work; and 5) Agency.\r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1.

         "General abstract\r\n\r\nMost organisms alternate between life stages that vary in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes, in the number of cells they possess, and in the environmental conditions in which they are best adapted to live. Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc. All team members will contribute by writing for blogs produced by professional societies for the public.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nExisting macroalgal taxa samples from across a latitudinal gradient in the western Antarctic Peninsula will be used to explore patterns of genetic diversity from the center to the southern latitudinal limits of their range. Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The general science goal of the research is to advance understanding of feedback from cloud and moist convection to carbon dioxide radiative forcing, which is one of the most fundamental questions in modern climate science. \r\n\r\nThis project specifically seeks to advance several key aspects of climate modeling and future climate projections by identifying model parameters that can reproduce both past and present-day sea surface temperature gradients and north-south precipitation delta-deuterium gradients.  \r\n\r\nThe rational for the research strategy is founded on the notion that the reduction in the tropical to mid-latitude sea surface temperature gradient, as shown by proxy records across Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, is a common feature of past warm intervals but remains difficult for climate models to replicate. This model-data discrepancy (termed “the low-gradient problem”) is closely tied to the parameterizations of cloud, moist convection, and ocean mixing, which remain highly uncertain and limit the confidence of predicted future climate change by models. Narrowing down this uncertainty can benefit from data from past climates and targeted paleoclimate simulations.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts of this project include supporting early career scientists, post-doctoral scholar, graduate student, and undergraduate support and mentoring, and workshops for high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Equity in STEM is a critical part of collaboration. The overall goal of this RCN: Diversity in Ecology, Evolution, Marine Science, and Disease (RCN: DEEMD) is to promote collaboration and equity in ecology, evolution, marine science (EEMS) and the emerging infectious disease (EID) fields. These fields overlap in many different places, yet formal collaborative efforts need to be in place to facilitate equitable interactions. RCN:DEEMD aims to bridge both basic and social science approaches by 1) facilitating in-person workshops, 2) developing virtual working groups, 3) establishing and maintaining a mentorship program, and 4) generating a framework for more equity in approaches to EEMS and EID research. Early career training is provided through webinars and seminars to support training, professional development, laboratory exchanges, and career preparation. Assessments are done through surveys for the overall RCN, the in person workshops, and the mentorship program. Products from RCN: DEEMD are being widely disseminated through and other communication platforms.\r\n\r\nClimate change and other human induced stressors can cause an increase of pathogens spreading between wildlife and humans. EIDs can have devastating consequences on biodiversity while also highlighting the health inequities experienced in human populations world wide. Globally, EIDs often disproportionately affect marginalized and impoverished human populations. Such disparities start long before peak disease outbreaks and extend to interactions with wildlife. Therefore, it is critical to understand the underlying ecological, and evolutionary context of disease dynamics and their impact on vulnerable wildlife and human populations. However, to accomplish this, there needs to be more equity and diversity in the scientists that are studying this very large issue. Through the development of RCN: DEEMD investigation of the intersection of basic science and social science in EIDs is being achieved by integrating approaches from EEMS. Diverse research collaborations from underrepresented groups are being elevated to help develop a better structure for integrative communication to tackle such a large issue.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, Division of Environmental Biology, and Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "FTIR imaging microscopes provide a way for chemists to do rapid, non-destructive, chemical analyses of a wide variety of minerals, glasses and materials, with resolution down to one-quarter the width of a human hair. FTIR stands for Fourier Transform Infrared — the microscopes work their magic by exploiting the vibrational absorptions of chemical compounds in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The materials being studied in this project include volcanic glasses, to better understand Earth’s cycling of carbon dioxide and water, and micro-plastics, to identify pollution sources, sinks, and pathways. The proposed instrument is the LUMOS-II imaging microscope, a state-of-the-art instrument from Brüker that won the GOLD Award for the best new scientific instrument at Pittcon 2020, an annual conference showcasing advances in analytical research and scientific instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe new instrumentation will enable a wide range of applications, including 1) distribution of volatiles in mantle sources and their fluxes in mid-ocean ridge, ocean island, and subduction environments, 2) origin and evolution of volatiles in tephra and melt inclusions with emphasis on eruption dynamics, and 3) studies of environmental microplastics in Tampa Bay and beyond, contributing to a comprehensive study of pollutants in the region’s water, sediments, and biota. The FTIR imaging microscope is a remarkably robust instrument that will allow students to rapidly obtain high-resolution datasets. Funding is included to enable undergraduate students to travel to, or virtual participation in, annual conferences of professional societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are an expected consequence of rising greenhouse gas levels, and the past several decades have seen a dramatic increase in global SST.  But the eastern tropical Pacific has not warmed as expected despite substantial West Pacific warming.  The reasons for the absence of East Pacific warming are not clear and the lack of warming stands in contrast to the SST trend patterns in model simulations, which typically show an El Nino-like pattern with greater warming to the east.  The opposition between observed and simulated Pacific trend patterns has attracted considerable interest among climate scientists, as the warming pattern matters for both regional climate impacts and the overall amount of warming caused by greenhouse gas increases.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here seeks to understand the physical mechanisms that account for the difference in Pacific warming patterns between simulations and observations.  The project involves comparisons between full-complexity climate models and the Zebiak-Cane (ZC) model, a highly idealized atmosphere-ocean model built to capture the basic dynamics of El Nino.  The model produces an SST trend pattern similar to the observations and thus provides an important point of reference for understanding the physical mechanisms that produce the pattern.  The work involves adding mechanisms to the ZC model and disabling the same mechanisms in a full-complexity climate model to understand the effects of particular mechanisms.  A key consideration is the role of mean state bias in the simulated pattern, as earlier work suggests that simulations produce an incorrect trend pattern due to a well-known \"cold tongue\" bias in which the strip of cold SST along the eastern equatorial Pacific is too long and too cold.\r\n\r\nThe work is of practical as well as scientific interest due to the implications of the SST pattern for regional climate impacts.  These include the distribution and intensity of Pacific tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) and the effect of Pacific warming on drought in the US Southwest.  In addition, the award provides for the career development of a Postdoctoral Research Fellow (PRF), who will work with mentors Tiffany Shaw and Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in the four closely linked leadership goals of this project which include: 1) producing and maintaining long-term and short-term integrated science and drilling technology plans in collaboration with the U.S. and international ice coring and drilling research communities, 2) providing field support with drilling equipment and expertise to support NSF-funded science, 3) identifying new technology needs and seeking funding for technology development and acquisition, and 4) enhancing communication and information exchange related to ice coring and drilling science and technology within the US and international ice science community. These goals relate to the importance of evidence from the polar ice sheets from ice cores, subglacial bedrock cores, and boreholes to access the subglacial aqueous environment, which has led to many important discoveries that have revolutionized climate science. These discoveries have also had important impacts on policy and thus also have societal relevance. Continued U.S. scientific leadership in this area depends critically not only on the support of scientists doing this research but also on the continued support of a dedicated facility to provide the field drilling support and accomplish engineering and technology development activities. This program and its education and public outreach activities will nurture the inclusion of students of many ages, races, and genders, will help to launch graduate students into promising careers, and the resulting scientific discoveries will benefit all citizens. Achieving the goals of this project will enable the U.S. ice science research community to realize implementation of their national and internationally-coordinated scientific goals, lead the world in ice science discoveries, nurture the education and development of the next generation of scientists and engineers, and help to communicate the importance of the discoveries to all.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Measuring the spatial variation of chemical elements in soil, sediment and rock is crucial for understanding life-supporting processes in Earth’s Critical Zone – a thin near-surface zone where life, soil, water, rock, and air interact. This proposal aims to acquire a µ-XRF instrument to measure and map the spatial distribution of plant-essential nutrients (e.g., P, Ca, K) in modern and fossil soils. This instrument will also aid groundwater, sedimentology and geoarchaeology research by mapping chemical changes in minerals from aquifer sediments, flood and lake deposits, ancient river channels, and prehistoric rock quarries. The µ-XRF instrument at the University of Memphis will be used to train students and researchers residing in the broader mid-South region. This instrument, and the proposed Institute of µ-XRF at the University of Memphis, will create opportunities for students and promote diversity and inclusion through summer programs and visiting research fellows.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding how chemical elements are cycled between different Earth systems, e.g., plants, soil, rock, river and aquifer sediment, is needed to predict system behavior under environmental and climate change scenarios. A common problem in these geochemical studies is resolving spatial changes in chemical elements at the micrometer scale. Nondestructive spatial imaging of geochemistry using a µ-XRF instrument will provide a means to resolve small-scale 2- and 3-dimensional changes in chemical composition. This tool will support soil geomorphology, hydrology, and sedimentology research, providing insights into weathering processes, sediment deposition, and paleoclimate reconstruction. The µ-XRF will foster education and training for students in the economically distressed Delta Regional Authority area, benefiting early career scientists and providing research opportunities for up to 150 students over the next 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Given human’s expanding use of the ocean, there is increasing need to understand natural and anthropogenic noise impacts to sound-sensitive taxa. Understanding acoustic ecology is vital as given rates of ocean changes and the fact that science is still unraveling how marine animals use sound to communicate, detect predators, seek prey and find suitable habitat. To gain this knowledge there is a need for a cost-effective, extended-duration tool that allows researchers to easily and experimentally replay sound cues, manipulate soundscapes and introduce ‘noise’ in field-based experiments to address new questions in ocean ecology and conservation. This effort will support the build and testing of a scalable, cost-effective, ocean-ready and long-duration sound playback tool. This tool will enable scientists to gather new insight into how sound is used by and impacts diverse marine fauna. The research will focus pilot tests on coral reefs, imperiled hubs of biodiversity that support billions of USD in ecosystem services, and seek to enhance the attraction and settlement of young corals as a method to support and potentially rebuild reefs. The project will incorporate and train undergraduate and graduate students, young technicians, and engineers, including underrepresented minorities, in all aspects of this development and testing. This effort is designed to be self-sustaining so that once it is completed, other scientists and stakeholders will be able to use acoustic enrichment and new questions to support the redevelopment of reefs and conduct previously unobtainable ecosystem studies.  \r\n\r\nThe science will be piloted and optimized through beta-experiments replaying soundscapes to attract coral larvae and induce settlement onto reefs.  The team involved will leverage the emerging understanding of reef soundscapes, their own key data, and a beta-system, to enable this acoustically-mediated playback and larval settlement investigation tool. The technical components of the system will be durable and optimized for the playback of reef sounds, enhancing its dynamic range, sound propagation, and variety of sound patterns. The pilot tool will be tested and optimized at an established US Virgin Islands field station with years of measurements on soundscapes and community dynamics. Additional testing and user-feedback integrated will occur a new site in Year 2. From these calibrations, iterations and tests, the project will provide an important new natural-based instrument for the toolboxes of scientists and stakeholders to conduct novel acoustics studies surrounding the fields of marine ecology, changing oceans, physical oceanography, and broader basic ocean research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.\r\n\r\nCratons are the oldest and most stable parts of the Earth’s continents. During continental break-up or rifting events, these stable crustal areas split apart and eventually give way to magma rising from Earth’s deep interior and the formation of new crust. Volatile elements such as helium, nitrogen and carbon dioxide play an important role during all aspects of plate tectonics. Major volatiles are transported from the Earth’s surface into Earth’s interior during subduction and may accumulate below and within the stable cratons due to radiogenic production and upwelling from the mantle below. The mechanisms and time-scales of this accumulation remain poorly understood, yet are significant because these processes form reservoirs of economically valuable gases such as helium and hydrogen, and geologically important gases such as carbon dioxide. When cratons eventually break apart, these gases are released to the atmosphere and have potentially significant climatic impacts on geological time scales. The objective of this work is to determine the geological processes that control volatile production in the craton, their migration through the crust and release at the surface. The investigated field site is the area surrounding the Tanzania Craton, a type example of a stable craton surrounded by the East African Rift, and a location of intense magmatism and extensional tectonics. This particular geologic setting is ideally suited to investigate the formation processes of cratonic volatiles and their potential release mechanism due to magnetism and rifting. During the course of the project two Tanzanian students will get their Ph.D. education and experience at the Woods Hole/MIT graduate program and the University of New Mexico. The students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, data interpretation and application of these techniques for understanding the processes of reservoir formation of these economically valuable gases.     \r\n\r\nThis project is a comprehensive study of the volatile gases that are being emitted from gas and water seeps along the flanks of the Tanzanian craton - a region where the stable continental craton is actively being “cracked” by rifting and simultaneously heated by plume-induced volcanism. The overall aims are to understand: 1) the mechanisms by which gases have been produced and stored in stable cratons over >109-year timescales, and 2) how they are liberated and transported to the surface during cratonic breakup. The study primarily focuses on helium (He) and nitrogen (N2) and their isotopic characteristics, which are the main constituents of cratonic gas accumulation, but we will measure all other noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and their isotopes, CO2, CH4 (as well as their isotopes) and H2 in seeps. The PIs will use field- and lab-generated gas chemistry results to form an integrated model of gas formation and transport along the flanks of the Tanzania craton. Volatile fluxes will be calculated to understand the extent of gas release when a cratonic region is disrupted by rifting and volcanism. Determining how cratonic gases are released to the crust and eventually to the atmosphere is important for understanding volatile movements on large spatial and temporal scales. By constraining how volatiles are accumulated and released during steady-state rifting and magmatic conditions, the PIs will characterize cratonic volatile inventories and fluxes. This information will be of interest to the broader Earth science community, and provide valuable context to researchers studying the potential climatic effects when gases are abruptly released from the stable craton to the atmosphere as well as the formation of economically valuable gas reservoirs of helium and hydrogen. Two Tanzanian students will be jointly supervised by the PI’s of the award and trained in field and laboratory techniques at their respective institutions. There will be opportunity for the students to obtain in depth training in noble gas geochemistry, gas geochemistry and stable isotopes, as well as modeling approaches to understand the processes of formation of these economically valuable gas reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.\r\n\r\nCratons are the oldest and most stable parts of the Earth’s continents. During continental break-up or rifting events, these stable crustal areas split apart and eventually give way to magma rising from Earth’s deep interior and the formation of new crust. Volatile elements such as helium, nitrogen and carbon dioxide play an important role during all aspects of plate tectonics. Major volatiles are transported from the Earth’s surface into Earth’s interior during subduction and may accumulate below and within the stable cratons due to radiogenic production and upwelling from the mantle below. The mechanisms and time-scales of this accumulation remain poorly understood, yet are significant because these processes form reservoirs of economically valuable gases such as helium and hydrogen, and geologically important gases such as carbon dioxide. When cratons eventually break apart, these gases are released to the atmosphere and have potentially significant climatic impacts on geological time scales. The objective of this work is to determine the geological processes that control volatile production in the craton, their migration through the crust and release at the surface. The investigated field site is the area surrounding the Tanzania Craton, a type example of a stable craton surrounded by the East African Rift, and a location of intense magmatism and extensional tectonics. This particular geologic setting is ideally suited to investigate the formation processes of cratonic volatiles and their potential release mechanism due to magnetism and rifting. During the course of the project two Tanzanian students will get their Ph.D. education and experience at the Woods Hole/MIT graduate program and the University of New Mexico. The students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, data interpretation and application of these techniques for understanding the processes of reservoir formation of these economically valuable gases.     \r\n\r\nThis project is a comprehensive study of the volatile gases that are being emitted from gas and water seeps along the flanks of the Tanzanian craton - a region where the stable continental craton is actively being “cracked” by rifting and simultaneously heated by plume-induced volcanism. The overall aims are to understand: 1) the mechanisms by which gases have been produced and stored in stable cratons over >109-year timescales, and 2) how they are liberated and transported to the surface during cratonic breakup. The study primarily focuses on helium (He) and nitrogen (N2) and their isotopic characteristics, which are the main constituents of cratonic gas accumulation, but we will measure all other noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and their isotopes, CO2, CH4 (as well as their isotopes) and H2 in seeps. The PIs will use field- and lab-generated gas chemistry results to form an integrated model of gas formation and transport along the flanks of the Tanzania craton. Volatile fluxes will be calculated to understand the extent of gas release when a cratonic region is disrupted by rifting and volcanism. Determining how cratonic gases are released to the crust and eventually to the atmosphere is important for understanding volatile movements on large spatial and temporal scales. By constraining how volatiles are accumulated and released during steady-state rifting and magmatic conditions, the PIs will characterize cratonic volatile inventories and fluxes. This information will be of interest to the broader Earth science community, and provide valuable context to researchers studying the potential climatic effects when gases are abruptly released from the stable craton to the atmosphere as well as the formation of economically valuable gas reservoirs of helium and hydrogen. Two Tanzanian students will be jointly supervised by the PI’s of the award and trained in field and laboratory techniques at their respective institutions. There will be opportunity for the students to obtain in depth training in noble gas geochemistry, gas geochemistry and stable isotopes, as well as modeling approaches to understand the processes of formation of these economically valuable gas reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This grant provides three years of Community Facility Support for the Wisconsin Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer National Facility (WiscSIMS Lab). The WiscSIMS Lab performs precise and accurate analysis of isotopes in very small amounts of material to advance earth and environmental science research. These small-scale measurements can reveal hidden information about Earth processes, like the driving forces for volcanic eruptions, the speed of climatic changes, and the formation of critical-element minerals. The principal missions of the WiscSIMS Lab are to drive innovative research and to ensure that all visiting scientists, especially those funded by NSF, can obtain world-class SIMS data. The WiscSIMS Lab has been funded continuously as a National Facility since 2008 and is a leader in training in the next generation of scientists. More than 440 different researchers, including 146 student trainees and 27 postdoctoral trainees, have worked with WiscSIMS since it was established.\r\n\r\nWiscSIMS provides in situ, high spatial resolution, high-precision isotope analysis to advance geoscience research in paleoclimate, geochemistry, volcanology, geobiology, petrology, sedimentology, and tectonics. The WiscSIMS Lab is built around a large-radius, multicollector CAMECA IMS 1280 ion microprobe, analyzing primarily stable isotopes of Li, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe, but also trace elements, volatiles, and U-Pb isotopes. The WiscSIMS staff has developed state-of-the-art capabilities for precise and accurate in situ analysis of isotope ratios with small to ultra-small spot sizes. With renewed Community Facility Support, WiscSIMS will continue to make at least 50% of its beam time available each year to guest researchers. NSF projects will continue to receive the highest scheduling priority and a reduced fee rate. Community Facility Support funding will allow WiscSIMS to pay the salaries of the expert SIMS operators and support staff, who assist scientists to drive innovative applications of isotope analysis across the breadth of geoscience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This award involves a collaboration between the University of Colorado Denver and University of California Berkeley to study the ionosphere during a solar eclipse. Very low frequency radio observations will be made during the 2024 solar eclipse in the eastern United States.  A solar eclipse is a rare event in which the radiation from the sun is partially or totally obscured by the moon for a few minutes. A solar eclipse is not only spectacular to observe but also provides a rare opportunity to study the physical and chemical processes of the ionosphere. In particular, the lowest part of the ionosphere is significantly modified by the sun and is difficult to study. A solar eclipse offers the opportunity to observe a day-night-day change of the ionosphere on the scale of a few minutes.  Observations made during an eclipse therefore provide a key insight into how the sun changes the lower ionosphere. Understanding the lower ionosphere is important to improving long distant communications and understanding space weather processes that affect an increasing number of technologies.  A number of students from the diverse populations at both universities will support the effort and be trained to make low frequency radio wave observations and their interpretations. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project combines the resources of CU Denver and UC Berkeley to study the lower ionosphere during the solar eclipse of 2024 in the United States, using VLF and ELF remote sensing techniques. Three types of receiver hardware will be used to make synergistic observations during the solar eclipse events. The observations will be interpreted with numerical modeling efforts to answer outstanding questions on the dynamics of the lower ionosphere during an eclipse.  The three science questions are 1) What is the lateral and vertical structure of the ionosphere in the totality zone of the solar eclipse? 2) What are the observed ionospheric perturbations when the region of totality is near a powerful VLF transmitter? and 3) What is the lower ionosphere characteristic reaction time to a point like perturbation from the eclipse?  The specifics of the 2024 total solar eclipse bring the lunar shadow to the close vicinity of the most powerful VLF transmitter in the United States.  This offers a unique opportunity to study a solar eclipse with higher resolution and in the presence of local heating effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The technique would provide images of water temperature and current velocity fields in a cross-section delineated by an existing telecommunication and power cable laid on the sea floor off one of the Azores islands. Images would be generated with unprecedented resolution (10 m in space, minutes in time) through the development of a ‘noise interferometry’ technique as part of the Distributed Acoustic Sensing. The technique measures the cable stretching caused by pressure changes and how such cable stretching varies over time. The noise interferometry values will be compared to measurements from conventional oceanographic moorings and ocean bottom seismometers. The study will assess the noise interferometry method in several ways: quantify its skill; demonstrate its robustness to uncertainties; determine its feasibility to depict turbulence properties; and apply it to research on internal tidal fluxes around the island of Madeira. As Broader Impacts, the project will provide information with spatial and temporal resolutions that should allow improvements in the skill of climate model projections. Also, the project will strengthen a collaboration with the UK while providing training for four Naval Postgraduate School graduate students and two undergraduate interns at University of California San Diego.\r\n \r\nThis is a joint US-NSF/UK-NERC proposal to obtain high resolution (10 m in space, minutes in time) distributions of temperature (sound speed) and velocity fields above a 34-km cable laid on the seabed off Madeira Island. Distributions will be drawn by developing a noise interferometry technique, which combines acoustic and gravity wave noise interferometry methods through Distributed Acoustic Sensing. The approach measures strain and strain rate values throughout an existing telecommunication and power cable on the ocean’s bed. The noise interferometry values will be compared to measurements from conventional oceanographic moorings and ocean bottom seismometers. The study will assess the noise interferometry method in several ways: quantify its skill; demonstrate its robustness to uncertainties and variations in mechanical coupling between cables and the seabed; determine its feasibility to depict turbulent dissipation rates; and applying it to research on internal tidal fluxes interacting with the island of Madeira, and associated tidally-driven turbulence in the bottom boundary layer over the topographic slope. Results will be analyzed in the context of internal wave interactions and of bottom boundary layer properties. In terms of Broader Impacts, the project will provide information with spatial and temporal resolutions that should allow improvements in the skill of climate model projections. Also, the project will strengthen a collaboration with the UK while providing training for four Naval Postgraduate School graduate students and two undergraduate interns at University of California San Diego.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Continental-scale ice sheets in the polar regions (i.e., Antarctica and Greenland) hold 99 percent of the fresh water on Earth. These ice sheets are prone to undergoing fast changes in a shifting climate and may contribute significantly to future sea level rise. The physical properties of the ice sheets contain important information that can aid understanding of ice sheet dynamics (why they move) and provide hints on how ice sheets themselves respond to the changing climate. Therefore, making comprehensive observations of the time-dependent physical properties of the ice sheets is critical to better predict how much and how fast these systems will contribute to sea level rise. By leveraging existing seismic data, this project will aid the understanding of how seismic properties within and beneath the ice sheets change over time. Seasonal changes in subglacial conditions, revealed by seismic energy from remote earthquakes and ambient noise, are directly related to the evolution of subglacial hydrological systems. Targets of the research include near-surface seismic properties, which will reveal possible changes within and local conditions of the firn, a shallow layer used to understand long-term trends and improve regional climate models. Results from Antarctica will be compared to those from the Greenland ice sheet to isolate true seasonal signatures in the response of ice sheets in northern and southern polar regions to seasonal atmospheric and climate forcing. Further, sub-glacial solid Earth properties help constrain the geology of the ice-covered continent. In addition to the research efforts, the project will support a female graduate student, a female scientist and an early career (non-tenured) faculty, with additional educational efforts catering to the needs of K-12 and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nSeismic properties within and beneath Antarctic ice sheets reflect physical changes in firn and subglacial hydrological systems and thus contain information on how the ice sheets are changing now and may change in the future. Seismic ambient noise and teleseismic wave measurements display geographical and temporal variations of near-surface and deeper properties, described to date in polar regions such as Greenland. A systematic survey of temporal variations has not yet been performed across all of Antarctica. Preliminary findings suggest seasonal variations in seismic observations (e.g., up to ±20% annual shear velocity change), and initial comparisons between sensors and hemispheres suggest true physical changes within the ice sheet and at its base are being detected. This project will perform a comprehensive analysis of seismic data collected by more than 600 stations in Antarctica over the past two decades, focusing on seasonal and long-term temporal changes recorded in various data products from both body and surface waves. This project will investigate: 1) Body-wave receiver function waveform analysis and their vertical-to-horizontal initial amplitude ratio, a novel approach to investigate shear velocity in the top few meters to several km; 2) Surface wave analysis (horizontal-to-vertical ratios method using both ambient noise and teleseismic earthquakes); and 3) Ambient noise coda, which helps characterize subglacial hydrological systems. Notably, the first two measurements (horizontal-to-vertical ratios and radio-frequency amplitudes) will be incorporated in a novel method to constrain temporal changes in the top tens of meters of the ice sheet down to tens of kilometers depth, resolving the ice sheet base and crust below.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Climate change, erosion, and poorly suited housing pose serious threats to the infrastructure of dozens of northern Alaskan villages. In many of these communities, people must decide whether to protect in place, undertake a managed retreat, or relocate entirely. Each decision seriously impacts livelihood and well-being. This project investigates housing strategies that Alaska Native communities are using to adapt to climate change and how these strategies might be improved by involving more user perspectives in planning processes. Through outreach activities and participatory workshops, researchers will work with Alaska Native communities and with policymakers to develop, share, and evaluate possible housing solutions. This project will generate publicly accessible multimedia products to educate, engage, and disseminate design prototypes, local resources, data, and relocation planning tools. \r\n\r\nThis research explores how co-design practices are being used in infrastructural planning projects and the impact that these practices have on how communities make decisions about whether to protect in place, engage in managed retreat, or relocate. Five intersecting research objectives guide this investigation: (1) Gather insights on the experiences of residents in housing projects in recent decades, (2) Identify the specialized tools, communicative practices, and modeling activities through which housing experts design infrastructural solutions with and without Alaska Native communities, (3) Map the flow of information and expertise included in housing decisions, (4) Comparatively analyze and explore various data sets through the creation of multimodal forms for broadening participation in planning activities, and (5) Establish access to knowledge that bridges academic research, building science policies, and the rich stores of local experience. This project will generate timely scholarship on housing futures in Alaska and advance understanding of participatory climate adaptation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Climate change, erosion, and poorly suited housing pose serious threats to the infrastructure of dozens of northern Alaskan villages. In many of these communities, people must decide whether to protect in place, undertake a managed retreat, or relocate entirely. Each decision seriously impacts livelihood and well-being. This project investigates housing strategies that Alaska Native communities are using to adapt to climate change and how these strategies might be improved by involving more user perspectives in planning processes. Through outreach activities and participatory workshops, researchers will work with Alaska Native communities and with policymakers to develop, share, and evaluate possible housing solutions. This project will generate publicly accessible multimedia products to educate, engage, and disseminate design prototypes, local resources, data, and relocation planning tools. \r\n\r\nThis research explores how co-design practices are being used in infrastructural planning projects and the impact that these practices have on how communities make decisions about whether to protect in place, engage in managed retreat, or relocate. Five intersecting research objectives guide this investigation: (1) Gather insights on the experiences of residents in housing projects in recent decades, (2) Identify the specialized tools, communicative practices, and modeling activities through which housing experts design infrastructural solutions with and without Alaska Native communities, (3) Map the flow of information and expertise included in housing decisions, (4) Comparatively analyze and explore various data sets through the creation of multimodal forms for broadening participation in planning activities, and (5) Establish access to knowledge that bridges academic research, building science policies, and the rich stores of local experience. This project will generate timely scholarship on housing futures in Alaska and advance understanding of participatory climate adaptation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Part 1:  This project focuses on a group of ecologically important species of fishes which inhabit the frigid waters of Antarctica. They represent a key link in the polar food web as they are prey for penguins, seals and toothed whales. These fish have evolved in the constant, extreme cold for millions of years and therefore, are very sensitive to the increasing water temperatures associated with global warming. These studies will investigate the impacts of incremental heat exposure on the biology of these fishes by examining their ability to respond, or inability to respond, to elevated temperatures. The project will employ cutting-edge technology to examine responses at the cellular level that may help these environmentally sensitive fishes adapt to the challenges of global warming. The primary goal is to increase our collective understanding of how polar ecosystems are likely to be impacted in the coming decades.\r\n\r\nPart 2:  The proposed research is designed to use an existing bank of frozen tissues from a species of cold-adapted Antarctic fish to investigate protein-level responses to heat stress. These samples were collected earlier in the PI's career during fieldwork at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Four tissues (control as well as heat- stressed) will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize their proteome, defined as the entire complement of proteins in a sample. This includes both identification and quantification of these proteins. The goal is to determine what mechanisms of response to elevated temperature are available to the extremely cold-adapted, stenothermic fishes of Antarctica. Follow-up analyses will use immunoblotting (Western blotting) with antibodies specific to a sub-set of proteins revealed to be heat-responsive in the proteomic analyses. As this is a Mid-Career Advancement Award, training and mentorship in proteomic analyses for the PI will be supported, with time spent at the partner institution, the University of California, Davis. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nWhile there has been an increase in the use of genomic technologies to probe gene expression profiles in Antarctic species, few studies exist looking at protein level changes during exposure to heat stress in these organisms. Therefore, the proposed studies would represent a large leap forward in our understanding of how these environmentally sensitive species can, or cannot, respond at the cellular level as the Earth continues to warm and water temperatures rise. As proteins do the \"work\" in the cell, it's vital to understand which proteins are present and in what quantity and how dynamic this \"proteome\" is during stress. The proposed studies would provide this information for thousands of proteins, using already existing samples. The findings would be entirely novel and would allow us a much better picture of how animals that evolved in the cold for millions of years are likely to respond to climate change. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe PI has established relationships with several regional K-12 institutions and will continue to provide outreach in the form of classroom visits and the creation of classroom curricula. The PI has an on-going collaboration with the Oregon Coast Aquarium (Newport, OR) to create novel teaching materials for grades 6-8. The Aquarium has partners in surrounding school districts and will help disseminate videos about marine biology and climate change. Modules concerning polar species will be created under this proposal. An interactive website will be created demonstrating the Antarctic food web. All of the proteomic analyses and libraries generated under this award will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This study will investigate uranium (U) cycling in oxygen-depleted conditions on the ocean floor, the most important sink of U. Improving our understanding of U geochemistry is critical for geological applications as diverse as dating the age of rocks, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, water quality, and securing new critical mineral sources. Reconstructing the oxygen levels of ancient oceans helps to link the evolution of the environment with evolution of life on Earth and potentially on exoplanets. Interpreting tools to probe oxygen levels in the oceans through time, such as U and other elements sensitive to oxygen level, remain challenging because of the unknowns about how they behave in low-oxygen marine settings. To address this knowledge gap, this project will track the presence of a new U species, U(+V), and investigate its role in the U cycle in modern and ancient oceans. These results will provide important insights for reconstructions of oxygen of Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, as well as the global U cycle more broadly. \r\n\r\nThe host phases and speciation of U in marine settings remain largely unknown, hampering our ability to reconstruct depositional conditions. This project will investigate U burial in the most significant marine sink to characterize the relationship between U speciation, removal pathways, and whole-rock U geochemistry, including its isotope composition. This goal will be accomplished with: (1) experiments of U phases relevant to marine settings; (2) characterizing the relationship between U speciation and U geochemistry in organic-rich shales and sediments; and (3) developing an interpretive model to predict U geochemistry from contextual information. In addition to graduate training, this project will promote museum collections and science communication for Earth and environmental science majors and K-12 outreach in environmental geosciences in rural Pennsylvania and Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "A fundamental challenge in hydrology is to explain where and when different hydrologic processes occur, and how they are controlled by climate and landscape. Hydrologic processes describe how water moves through and is stored within the landscape on its path from rainfall or snowfall to river flow. Large-scale process knowledge is valuable for a wide range of applications such as designing realistic and accurate flow forecasting models, and choosing effective interventions to improve water quality. Many scientific organizations maintain intensively monitored watersheds that provide deep understanding of hydrologic processes at specific locations, but the knowledge is fragmented and difficult to integrate across regions and continents. This project will unify field hydrology studies into a global picture, by creating and exploring a searchable database of hydrologic process knowledge. The project will enable the hydrology community to apply modern, big data approaches to knowledge discovery, and to draw out emergent patterns that relate landscape organization and hydrologic function. The project team will work with undergraduate students to develop tutorials and hands-on activities to explore the database in the form of a Student Toolkit. To engage with the hydrology community and enhance the impact of the results, the project team will build a web app and online map discovery interface for the database.\r\n\r\nThe project will create a relational database to represent process knowledge, and populate the database with extensive knowledge from hundreds of experimental watersheds, using standardized workflows to maintain quality. The database will use a taxonomy of hydrologic processes to enable labelling, organizing and hierarchical searching for process information. The investigators will explore the database to synthesize global patterns of hydrologic function, to analyze how dominant processes can be explained by physical watershed features, and to reveal transitions in processes at events and seasonal timescales. They will apply the database to evaluate new generation continental-domain hydrologic models, which currently lack the process data needed to select model structure. They will test whether flow predictions improve when models accurately represent processes, and whether model sensitivity analysis identifies the same dominant processes as those found experimentally. The long-term vision for the database includes a role as “ground truth” for future far-reaching machine learning efforts such as automatic literature and data analysis for process prediction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Plant communities respond to climate change by moving and changing, but current predictions lack mechanistic connections between plant function and environmental change. Plant community responses are observed repeatedly in the fossil record, and could help predict future changes by measuring traits from plant fossils. Much effort has focused on the ways that leaves respond to and record environmental conditions. However, leaves depend on long-lived organs, such as stems, to enable plant function. This study will establish a new database dedicated to plant stem traits from fossil xylem to understand plant community responses to major intervals of ancient climate change. More broadly, this project will prepare a new generation of Earth scientists for this highly interdisciplinary work and expand participation in research through training and mentoring targeted towards underrepresented groups in paleontology through the creation of a paleontology and ecosystem modeling short course. \r\n\r\nThis project is focused on assessing water transport in the xylem of Paleozoic and Mesozoic plants as an adaptation that influenced survivorship across two major intervals of climate change: the Late Paleozoic Ice Age of the Carboniferous-Permian (~300 million years ago [Ma]) and the hothouse climate of the Triassic-Jurassic (~200 Ma). This project will focus on three specific aims: (1) establish a unified xylem fossil functional anatomy database to facilitate (2) prediction of hydraulic traits for extinct taxa and (3) integration of fossil-observed leaf and xylem traits to predict whole-plant function using a modified ecosystem process model (Paleo-BGC). Investigators will use this approach to assess extinct plant water stress and ecosystem function through periods of extreme global climate change and test the hypothesis that coordination of leaf and stem water transport traits distinguished taxa as casualties, survivors, and thrivers during floral collapse and recovery during both global cooling and warming events. This project prioritizes training a new generation of interdisciplinary Earth scientists through training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars. Additionally, a short course for underrepresented and early career scientists focused on linking paleobotany, plant physiology, and climate change will be created. Pre- and post-course summative evaluations will be applied with an aim to improve future course iterations’ delivery of climate-change-focused interdisciplinary geoscience to the target audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A Rigaku MiniFlex 6G X-ray diffractometer and an IXRF Iridium Ultra Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy System will enable mineralogical and chemical analysis to understand the cycling of metals between water, minerals, and biota. This information can help inform technologies aimed at treating environmental contaminants. This equipment acquisition will benefit science discovery and society by providing insights into biogeochemical cycling processes which in turn can improve treatment and remediation of environmental contaminants.  Increase of student engagement by providing access and training to this equipment in course work and research projects will enhance undergraduate education across Environmental Science, Biology and Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation purchased with this award will be used to examine (1) how airborne fungi produce calcium-containing minerals (2) ways for toxic lead to be stabilized in Philadelphia soils, and (3) how mineral co-precipitation of barite can remove toxic arsenic and chromium from wastewaters produced from oil and gas operations. In particular, X-ray diffraction will be used to identify minerals produced by fungi in laboratory cultures, minerals in soils collected around contaminated sites in Philadelphia, and minerals co-precipitated with contaminants from simulated fracking wastewaters. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy will be used to map the incorporation of metals into bio-precipitated minerals with fungal biomass, the location of lead in soil minerals and plants grown in contaminated soils, and to map the distribution of arsenic and chromium in barite mineral particles produced from simulated wastewater treatments. Collaborations will also be developed across the Philadelphia region with a focus on affordable, undergraduate access to instrumentation for research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and the second largest in the world, is big enough to make its own weather.  The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).\r\n\r\nThe work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.

         "Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and the second largest in the world, is big enough to make its own weather.  The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).\r\n\r\nThe work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.  Rainfall is a hazard as well as a resource given that much of the rain falls in severe storms, a particular hazard for the fishing fleet.  The PIs conduct public outreach regarding climate change in the region through a traveling museum exhibit to be presented at the Mayborn Museum at Baylor University and at the National Museum of Kenya.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin and one at Baylor University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "South Carolina State University (SCSU), in collaboration with over seventeen other academic institutions in South Carolina and Geogia, will organize a 1.5 days-long conference in Savannah, GA that will bring together a diverse constellation of academic, public, and private sector representatives to build leadership, enhance partnerships, and improve the capacity of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and women-only colleges in South Carolina and Georgia to diversify, strengthen, and expand a rapidly evolving geoscience workforce. Outcomes of the conference will include a report outlining gaps, challenges, and opportunities linked to preparing students at participating institutions for diverse geoscience career pathways. The report will include recommendations for academia, public, and private sectors to address those gaps, challenges, and opportunities. This project will launch the foundation for a community of practice that continues to learn and share good practices and ideas, beyond the award period.\r\n\r\nThe conference organizers will bring together faculty and administrators from HBCUs and women-only institutions in SC and GA, funding-agency representatives, and employers in private and public sectors. The goal of the conference is to 1) identify curriculum gaps and challenges linked to lack of preparation for students for geoscience jobs, 2) develop recommendations for participating institutions, employers and funding agencies to address the gaps and challenges, and 3) lay the groundwork for future collaborations. This project is jointly funded by Directorate of Geosciences' Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) and the Division of Research, Innovations, Synergies and Education (RISE), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

NCALM provides airborne laser scanning surveys, high-resolution airborne digital images, and data processing expertise to the earth science community for the creation of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) data of Earth’s surface (topography), the built-environment, and vegetation. These 3D data are used by scientists to study natural processes such as landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, the modeling of flood behavior, and storage of atmospheric carbon in forests, among many applications. NCALM is focused on three primary goals: 1) train and educate graduate students to meet the needs of industry, government, and academia; 2) advance technology that allows for the creation of high-resolution and high-accuracy 3D data; and 3) provide research-quality 3D digital data to the scientific community.\r\n \r\nUnder the current award, NCALM will continue providing the research community with research-quality elevation data of Earth’s surface (topography, vegetation, and shallow water bathymetry) and digital aerial imaging.  A key contribution of the facility has been the Seed project program for which graduate students from US institutions prepare proposals to request lidar data for their thesis or dissertation.  These requests are competitively evaluated by an independent committee based on intellectual merit and broader impacts.  NCALM will pilot activities aimed at increasing participation in the Seed program by students from minority serving institutions (MSIs). These activities include a workshop to solicit input from MSI geoscience faculty, establishment of a short-term MSI faculty-in-residence program at NCALM, and encouraging Seed project applications from underrepresented minorities. With the accelerating effects of climate change and the increase in natural hazards in the US, there is a need to rapidly acquire high-resolution topography data immediately after an extreme event. In response to this evolving need, NCALM will pilot an \"NCALM NOW\" service through which researchers can request surveys to quickly acquire perishable data immediately after events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In this Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project, the PI will join a team of researchers at the University of California Irvine in order to study the properties of ultrafine aerosol emissions from brake wear via laboratory experiments and a small-scale filter-based field campaign. Aerosol emissions from brake wear has recently been identified as a major contributor to non-exhaust related emissions from the transportation sector and with the ongoing shift to electric vehicles, the relative important of non-exhaust emissions are of growing importance. The PI will additionally collaborate with a local nonprofit organization working towards improved air quality and cleaner air as well as collaborate with filmmakers in order to produce bilingual (English and Spanish) science education videos related to this research. \r\n\r\nThe work includes three research questions: (1) What are the physiochemical properties of ultrafine particles formed from break wear? (2) How do these properties change after undergoing secondary atmospheric processing including oxidation and photodegradation? (3) Are ultrafine particles from brake wear present in ambient samples from Santa Ana, California? There are three main research approaches: (1) laboratory experiments on the formation of ultrafine particles from brake emissions; (2) the use of an oxidation flow reactor to characterize the formation of secondary species; and (3) the collection of ultrafine particles generated from brake wear emissions on filters within Santa Ana, California, and the study of their chemistry via exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Multiple instruments will be used during this project including various mass spectrometers as well as a transmission electron microscope.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Various plasma waves are excited in near-Earth space during geomagnetic storms, and the waves affect the behavior of particles carrying the ring current and the strength of the flux of energetic electrons in the radiation belts.  Ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves with frequencies below 100 mHz play an essential role in this regard, and understanding the spatial and temporal occurrence patterns and the excitation mechanism of the waves is a crucial element in magnetospheric research. The investigation focuses on a recently reported new type of compressional ULF waves in the inner magnetosphere with a symmetric (fundamental) mode structure about the magnetic equator. Antisymmetric (second harmonic) waves are commonly detected and well-documented in the literature.  The team aims to determine the relevance of drift compressional instability (DCI) to stormtime magnetospheric ULF waves. The investigation has broader impacts regarding wave-particle interactions occurring on other planets and in laboratory plasmas.  In addition, the investigation will contribute to building improved space weather models that are valuable beyond the context of basic research.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the investigation is to observationally determine whether the physical properties of symmetric ULF waves and the particle environment associated with the symmetric waves are consistent with DCI.  To this end, we will use data from the Van Allen Probes (RBSP), which include electric and magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles. With the RBSP mission providing measurements in the inner magnetosphere ( < 6) over a 7-year period (2012–2019), the data are ideal for determining the mode structure of ULF waves, their spatial and temporal distributions, and the properties of the background particles.  We will determine the mode structure by paying attention to the relation between the spacecraft latitude and the location of the equatorial node/antinode of ULF waves. The relevance of DCI to observed symmetric waves will be discussed by evaluating the theoretical instability condition using observationally determined energy and radial distance dependence of the phase space density of ions in the ring current energy range (1-300 keV). We will discuss the statistically determined spatial occurrence pattern of the waves in relation to the drift of ions injected from a nightside source region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to advance knowledge of tsunami hazards along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the main source for earthquakes and tsunamis  in the US Pacific Northwest. This work will map ancient tsunami deposits preserved in the geologic record and combine this data with advanced models to simulate tsunami impacts along the coast. These results will deepen understanding of how past earthquakes have behaved in this region. The specific focus will be on the last major earthquake in the region that occurred in the year 1700. This research will directly impact public safety and preparedness in the region. The insights gained will help to improve hazard maps, emergency and evacuation plans, building codes, and the design of tsunami evacuation structures. Furthermore, the project will support a collaboration with the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. This tribe has built North America's first free-standing tsunami evacuation tower, and the collaboration will help to advance community engagement and education regarding seismic risks. Through ths work, this project will serve as a vital investment in public safety and knowledge dissemination. \r\n  \r\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ), focusing on the seismic and tsunami activity around the year 1700 CE. To accomplish this, the team will carry out high-resolution mapping of paleotsunami deposits at two key locations along the CSZ and execute thousands of advanced tsunami inundation models. These efforts aim to test various hypotheses of what kinds of earthquake slip distributions can explain actual field observations, addressing gaps in the current understanding of tsunami deposit distribution. By employing innovative techniques such as analyzing sediment cores, microfossils, and sediment geochemistry, the results will delineate the full extent of tsunami inundation with high resolution at these new sites. This approach will help in validating or excluding different earthquake scenarios and contribute to a more precise understanding of the CSZ's seismic behavior. This research is fundamental for accurate seismic and tsunami mapping and has wide-ranging implications for practical hazard applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Geoscience as a profession is at a crossroads with respect to attracting individuals from diverse populations and training future geoscientists. Western Oregon University (WOU) will develop a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem, which is a collaborative partnership between a four-year public university, natural resource focused government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and regional geoscience employers. The goal of the partnership is to cultivate Earth science literacy and motivate novel solutions to local environmental issues, while connecting diverse student populations to the geoscience discipline with altruistic motivations for pursuing future careers as professionals. The project will engage and invigorate a new generation of geoscience professionals, particularly those who have been structurally excluded in the sciences. Existing elements of WOU’s Earth and Environmental Science program will be strengthened with the intentional cultivation of an enhanced Geo-STEM learning ecosystem that provides professional mentorship and career-outreach experiences, designed to increase awareness of opportunities for professional outcomes in early career undergraduates who otherwise lack access. \r\n\r\nThe overarching project goal is to strengthen a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem and engage more young people in geosciences at the undergraduate level. The project will focus on mentored geoscience education through development of community water resource partnerships. Given that water resources and river restoration are iconic scientific themes in the Pacific Northwest, the WOU GEOPAths project team has adapted fundamental concepts of floodplain connectivity to the Geo-STEM learning ecosystem model, with the analogous intent of increasing connections between early career undergraduates to the geoscience profession. Specific objectives include: (1) increasing enrollment, diversity, and retention in the geosciences; (2) strengthening the statewide Geo-STEM learning ecosystem by fortifying connections to the professional community; and (3) testing novel approaches to recruitment of diverse populations in the geoscience profession. Extra-curricular experiences and training in the geosciences with a focus on service-learning and workforce training will lead to increased probabilities for student engagement, academic success, and positive career outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to build a cross-region innovative research group focused on equitable educational innovations to support historically excluded middle and high school youth–Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC), female-identifying youth, and youth in Title I schools or rural underserved districts–to develop embodied pathways to participation in geosciences communities. The key project activity will be the creation of a practitioner research group composed of community stakeholders, teachers, geoscience faculty, and educational community partners. This group will collaborate to develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation pathways for supporting historically excluded youth in geoscience communities of practice through hands-on fieldwork experiences and digital reflections. The stakeholders will form goals, identify success measures, and work to expand their program’s goals through developing a shared understanding around what equitable participation trajectories look like across similar domains.\r\n\r\nThe effects of underserved youth being excluded from the geosciences is readily reflected in the field however, less is known about the experiences of these youth in such trajectories and how geosciences educational stakeholders could redesign pathways to better serve the students. This project will use methods of community design research to 1) develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation in geoscience fieldwork; 2) develop shared best practices for facilitating more equitable participation in geosciences fieldwork and disciplinary conversations; and 3) support network partners in redesigning programs to set and meet expansive goals in this regard. Over the course of the project, the PI team will build a network of geosciences instructors and practitioners and work on iterative cycles of expanding their programmatic goals in alignment with the five key areas for the following outcomes: 1) Grounded fun; 2) STEM capital; 3) STEM trajectories; 4) STEM identity work; and 5) Agency.\r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.

Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.

         "General abstract\r\n\r\nMost organisms alternate between life stages that vary in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes, in the number of cells they possess, and in the environmental conditions in which they are best adapted to live. Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc. All team members will contribute by writing for blogs produced by professional societies for the public.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nExisting macroalgal taxa samples from across a latitudinal gradient in the western Antarctic Peninsula will be used to explore patterns of genetic diversity from the center to the southern latitudinal limits of their range. Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Equity in STEM is a critical part of collaboration. The overall goal of this RCN: Diversity in Ecology, Evolution, Marine Science, and Disease (RCN: DEEMD) is to promote collaboration and equity in ecology, evolution, marine science (EEMS) and the emerging infectious disease (EID) fields. These fields overlap in many different places, yet formal collaborative efforts need to be in place to facilitate equitable interactions. RCN:DEEMD aims to bridge both basic and social science approaches by 1) facilitating in-person workshops, 2) developing virtual working groups, 3) establishing and maintaining a mentorship program, and 4) generating a framework for more equity in approaches to EEMS and EID research. Early career training is provided through webinars and seminars to support training, professional development, laboratory exchanges, and career preparation. Assessments are done through surveys for the overall RCN, the in person workshops, and the mentorship program. Products from RCN: DEEMD are being widely disseminated through and other communication platforms.\r\n\r\nClimate change and other human induced stressors can cause an increase of pathogens spreading between wildlife and humans. EIDs can have devastating consequences on biodiversity while also highlighting the health inequities experienced in human populations world wide. Globally, EIDs often disproportionately affect marginalized and impoverished human populations. Such disparities start long before peak disease outbreaks and extend to interactions with wildlife. Therefore, it is critical to understand the underlying ecological, and evolutionary context of disease dynamics and their impact on vulnerable wildlife and human populations. However, to accomplish this, there needs to be more equity and diversity in the scientists that are studying this very large issue. Through the development of RCN: DEEMD investigation of the intersection of basic science and social science in EIDs is being achieved by integrating approaches from EEMS. Diverse research collaborations from underrepresented groups are being elevated to help develop a better structure for integrative communication to tackle such a large issue.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, Division of Environmental Biology, and Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "FTIR imaging microscopes provide a way for chemists to do rapid, non-destructive, chemical analyses of a wide variety of minerals, glasses and materials, with resolution down to one-quarter the width of a human hair. FTIR stands for Fourier Transform Infrared — the microscopes work their magic by exploiting the vibrational absorptions of chemical compounds in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The materials being studied in this project include volcanic glasses, to better understand Earth’s cycling of carbon dioxide and water, and micro-plastics, to identify pollution sources, sinks, and pathways. The proposed instrument is the LUMOS-II imaging microscope, a state-of-the-art instrument from Brüker that won the GOLD Award for the best new scientific instrument at Pittcon 2020, an annual conference showcasing advances in analytical research and scientific instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe new instrumentation will enable a wide range of applications, including 1) distribution of volatiles in mantle sources and their fluxes in mid-ocean ridge, ocean island, and subduction environments, 2) origin and evolution of volatiles in tephra and melt inclusions with emphasis on eruption dynamics, and 3) studies of environmental microplastics in Tampa Bay and beyond, contributing to a comprehensive study of pollutants in the region’s water, sediments, and biota. The FTIR imaging microscope is a remarkably robust instrument that will allow students to rapidly obtain high-resolution datasets. Funding is included to enable undergraduate students to travel to, or virtual participation in, annual conferences of professional societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are an expected consequence of rising greenhouse gas levels, and the past several decades have seen a dramatic increase in global SST.  But the eastern tropical Pacific has not warmed as expected despite substantial West Pacific warming.  The reasons for the absence of East Pacific warming are not clear and the lack of warming stands in contrast to the SST trend patterns in model simulations, which typically show an El Nino-like pattern with greater warming to the east.  The opposition between observed and simulated Pacific trend patterns has attracted considerable interest among climate scientists, as the warming pattern matters for both regional climate impacts and the overall amount of warming caused by greenhouse gas increases.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here seeks to understand the physical mechanisms that account for the difference in Pacific warming patterns between simulations and observations.  The project involves comparisons between full-complexity climate models and the Zebiak-Cane (ZC) model, a highly idealized atmosphere-ocean model built to capture the basic dynamics of El Nino.  The model produces an SST trend pattern similar to the observations and thus provides an important point of reference for understanding the physical mechanisms that produce the pattern.  The work involves adding mechanisms to the ZC model and disabling the same mechanisms in a full-complexity climate model to understand the effects of particular mechanisms.  A key consideration is the role of mean state bias in the simulated pattern, as earlier work suggests that simulations produce an incorrect trend pattern due to a well-known \"cold tongue\" bias in which the strip of cold SST along the eastern equatorial Pacific is too long and too cold.\r\n\r\nThe work is of practical as well as scientific interest due to the implications of the SST pattern for regional climate impacts.  These include the distribution and intensity of Pacific tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) and the effect of Pacific warming on drought in the US Southwest.  In addition, the award provides for the career development of a Postdoctoral Research Fellow (PRF), who will work with mentors Tiffany Shaw and Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This award provides support to the Ice Drilling Program (IDP) to provide community leadership and to operate and maintain a facility to support ice drilling engineering, field support, and education and outreach. The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in the four closely linked leadership goals of this project which include: 1) producing and maintaining long-term and short-term integrated science and drilling technology plans in collaboration with the U.S. and international ice coring and drilling research communities, 2) providing field support with drilling equipment and expertise to support NSF-funded science, 3) identifying new technology needs and seeking funding for technology development and acquisition, and 4) enhancing communication and information exchange related to ice coring and drilling science and technology within the US and international ice science community. These goals relate to the importance of evidence from the polar ice sheets from ice cores, subglacial bedrock cores, and boreholes to access the subglacial aqueous environment, which has led to many important discoveries that have revolutionized climate science. These discoveries have also had important impacts on policy and thus also have societal relevance. Continued U.S. scientific leadership in this area depends critically not only on the support of scientists doing this research but also on the continued support of a dedicated facility to provide the field drilling support and accomplish engineering and technology development activities. This program and its education and public outreach activities will nurture the inclusion of students of many ages, races, and genders, will help to launch graduate students into promising careers, and the resulting scientific discoveries will benefit all citizens. Achieving the goals of this project will enable the U.S. ice science research community to realize implementation of their national and internationally-coordinated scientific goals, lead the world in ice science discoveries, nurture the education and development of the next generation of scientists and engineers, and help to communicate the importance of the discoveries to all.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Measuring the spatial variation of chemical elements in soil, sediment and rock is crucial for understanding life-supporting processes in Earth’s Critical Zone – a thin near-surface zone where life, soil, water, rock, and air interact. This proposal aims to acquire a µ-XRF instrument to measure and map the spatial distribution of plant-essential nutrients (e.g., P, Ca, K) in modern and fossil soils. This instrument will also aid groundwater, sedimentology and geoarchaeology research by mapping chemical changes in minerals from aquifer sediments, flood and lake deposits, ancient river channels, and prehistoric rock quarries. The µ-XRF instrument at the University of Memphis will be used to train students and researchers residing in the broader mid-South region. This instrument, and the proposed Institute of µ-XRF at the University of Memphis, will create opportunities for students and promote diversity and inclusion through summer programs and visiting research fellows.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding how chemical elements are cycled between different Earth systems, e.g., plants, soil, rock, river and aquifer sediment, is needed to predict system behavior under environmental and climate change scenarios. A common problem in these geochemical studies is resolving spatial changes in chemical elements at the micrometer scale. Nondestructive spatial imaging of geochemistry using a µ-XRF instrument will provide a means to resolve small-scale 2- and 3-dimensional changes in chemical composition. This tool will support soil geomorphology, hydrology, and sedimentology research, providing insights into weathering processes, sediment deposition, and paleoclimate reconstruction. The µ-XRF will foster education and training for students in the economically distressed Delta Regional Authority area, benefiting early career scientists and providing research opportunities for up to 150 students over the next 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Given human’s expanding use of the ocean, there is increasing need to understand natural and anthropogenic noise impacts to sound-sensitive taxa. Understanding acoustic ecology is vital as given rates of ocean changes and the fact that science is still unraveling how marine animals use sound to communicate, detect predators, seek prey and find suitable habitat. To gain this knowledge there is a need for a cost-effective, extended-duration tool that allows researchers to easily and experimentally replay sound cues, manipulate soundscapes and introduce ‘noise’ in field-based experiments to address new questions in ocean ecology and conservation. This effort will support the build and testing of a scalable, cost-effective, ocean-ready and long-duration sound playback tool. This tool will enable scientists to gather new insight into how sound is used by and impacts diverse marine fauna. The research will focus pilot tests on coral reefs, imperiled hubs of biodiversity that support billions of USD in ecosystem services, and seek to enhance the attraction and settlement of young corals as a method to support and potentially rebuild reefs. The project will incorporate and train undergraduate and graduate students, young technicians, and engineers, including underrepresented minorities, in all aspects of this development and testing. This effort is designed to be self-sustaining so that once it is completed, other scientists and stakeholders will be able to use acoustic enrichment and new questions to support the redevelopment of reefs and conduct previously unobtainable ecosystem studies.  \r\n\r\nThe science will be piloted and optimized through beta-experiments replaying soundscapes to attract coral larvae and induce settlement onto reefs.  The team involved will leverage the emerging understanding of reef soundscapes, their own key data, and a beta-system, to enable this acoustically-mediated playback and larval settlement investigation tool. The technical components of the system will be durable and optimized for the playback of reef sounds, enhancing its dynamic range, sound propagation, and variety of sound patterns. The pilot tool will be tested and optimized at an established US Virgin Islands field station with years of measurements on soundscapes and community dynamics. Additional testing and user-feedback integrated will occur a new site in Year 2. From these calibrations, iterations and tests, the project will provide an important new natural-based instrument for the toolboxes of scientists and stakeholders to conduct novel acoustics studies surrounding the fields of marine ecology, changing oceans, physical oceanography, and broader basic ocean research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.\r\n\r\nCratons are the oldest and most stable parts of the Earth’s continents. During continental break-up or rifting events, these stable crustal areas split apart and eventually give way to magma rising from Earth’s deep interior and the formation of new crust. Volatile elements such as helium, nitrogen and carbon dioxide play an important role during all aspects of plate tectonics. Major volatiles are transported from the Earth’s surface into Earth’s interior during subduction and may accumulate below and within the stable cratons due to radiogenic production and upwelling from the mantle below. The mechanisms and time-scales of this accumulation remain poorly understood, yet are significant because these processes form reservoirs of economically valuable gases such as helium and hydrogen, and geologically important gases such as carbon dioxide. When cratons eventually break apart, these gases are released to the atmosphere and have potentially significant climatic impacts on geological time scales. The objective of this work is to determine the geological processes that control volatile production in the craton, their migration through the crust and release at the surface. The investigated field site is the area surrounding the Tanzania Craton, a type example of a stable craton surrounded by the East African Rift, and a location of intense magmatism and extensional tectonics. This particular geologic setting is ideally suited to investigate the formation processes of cratonic volatiles and their potential release mechanism due to magnetism and rifting. During the course of the project two Tanzanian students will get their Ph.D. education and experience at the Woods Hole/MIT graduate program and the University of New Mexico. The students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, data interpretation and application of these techniques for understanding the processes of reservoir formation of these economically valuable gases.     \r\n\r\nThis project is a comprehensive study of the volatile gases that are being emitted from gas and water seeps along the flanks of the Tanzanian craton - a region where the stable continental craton is actively being “cracked” by rifting and simultaneously heated by plume-induced volcanism. The overall aims are to understand: 1) the mechanisms by which gases have been produced and stored in stable cratons over >109-year timescales, and 2) how they are liberated and transported to the surface during cratonic breakup. The study primarily focuses on helium (He) and nitrogen (N2) and their isotopic characteristics, which are the main constituents of cratonic gas accumulation, but we will measure all other noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and their isotopes, CO2, CH4 (as well as their isotopes) and H2 in seeps. The PIs will use field- and lab-generated gas chemistry results to form an integrated model of gas formation and transport along the flanks of the Tanzania craton. Volatile fluxes will be calculated to understand the extent of gas release when a cratonic region is disrupted by rifting and volcanism. Determining how cratonic gases are released to the crust and eventually to the atmosphere is important for understanding volatile movements on large spatial and temporal scales. By constraining how volatiles are accumulated and released during steady-state rifting and magmatic conditions, the PIs will characterize cratonic volatile inventories and fluxes. This information will be of interest to the broader Earth science community, and provide valuable context to researchers studying the potential climatic effects when gases are abruptly released from the stable craton to the atmosphere as well as the formation of economically valuable gas reservoirs of helium and hydrogen. Two Tanzanian students will be jointly supervised by the PI’s of the award and trained in field and laboratory techniques at their respective institutions. There will be opportunity for the students to obtain in depth training in noble gas geochemistry, gas geochemistry and stable isotopes, as well as modeling approaches to understand the processes of formation of these economically valuable gas reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This grant provides three years of Community Facility Support for the Wisconsin Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer National Facility (WiscSIMS Lab). The WiscSIMS Lab performs precise and accurate analysis of isotopes in very small amounts of material to advance earth and environmental science research. These small-scale measurements can reveal hidden information about Earth processes, like the driving forces for volcanic eruptions, the speed of climatic changes, and the formation of critical-element minerals. The principal missions of the WiscSIMS Lab are to drive innovative research and to ensure that all visiting scientists, especially those funded by NSF, can obtain world-class SIMS data. The WiscSIMS Lab has been funded continuously as a National Facility since 2008 and is a leader in training in the next generation of scientists. More than 440 different researchers, including 146 student trainees and 27 postdoctoral trainees, have worked with WiscSIMS since it was established.\r\n\r\nWiscSIMS provides in situ, high spatial resolution, high-precision isotope analysis to advance geoscience research in paleoclimate, geochemistry, volcanology, geobiology, petrology, sedimentology, and tectonics. The WiscSIMS Lab is built around a large-radius, multicollector CAMECA IMS 1280 ion microprobe, analyzing primarily stable isotopes of Li, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe, but also trace elements, volatiles, and U-Pb isotopes. The WiscSIMS staff has developed state-of-the-art capabilities for precise and accurate in situ analysis of isotope ratios with small to ultra-small spot sizes. With renewed Community Facility Support, WiscSIMS will continue to make at least 50% of its beam time available each year to guest researchers. NSF projects will continue to receive the highest scheduling priority and a reduced fee rate. Community Facility Support funding will allow WiscSIMS to pay the salaries of the expert SIMS operators and support staff, who assist scientists to drive innovative applications of isotope analysis across the breadth of geoscience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This award involves a collaboration between the University of Colorado Denver and University of California Berkeley to study the ionosphere during a solar eclipse. Very low frequency radio observations will be made during the 2024 solar eclipse in the eastern United States.  A solar eclipse is a rare event in which the radiation from the sun is partially or totally obscured by the moon for a few minutes. A solar eclipse is not only spectacular to observe but also provides a rare opportunity to study the physical and chemical processes of the ionosphere. In particular, the lowest part of the ionosphere is significantly modified by the sun and is difficult to study. A solar eclipse offers the opportunity to observe a day-night-day change of the ionosphere on the scale of a few minutes.  Observations made during an eclipse therefore provide a key insight into how the sun changes the lower ionosphere. Understanding the lower ionosphere is important to improving long distant communications and understanding space weather processes that affect an increasing number of technologies.  A number of students from the diverse populations at both universities will support the effort and be trained to make low frequency radio wave observations and their interpretations. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project combines the resources of CU Denver and UC Berkeley to study the lower ionosphere during the solar eclipse of 2024 in the United States, using VLF and ELF remote sensing techniques. Three types of receiver hardware will be used to make synergistic observations during the solar eclipse events. The observations will be interpreted with numerical modeling efforts to answer outstanding questions on the dynamics of the lower ionosphere during an eclipse.  The three science questions are 1) What is the lateral and vertical structure of the ionosphere in the totality zone of the solar eclipse? 2) What are the observed ionospheric perturbations when the region of totality is near a powerful VLF transmitter? and 3) What is the lower ionosphere characteristic reaction time to a point like perturbation from the eclipse?  The specifics of the 2024 total solar eclipse bring the lunar shadow to the close vicinity of the most powerful VLF transmitter in the United States.  This offers a unique opportunity to study a solar eclipse with higher resolution and in the presence of local heating effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Continental-scale ice sheets in the polar regions (i.e., Antarctica and Greenland) hold 99 percent of the fresh water on Earth. These ice sheets are prone to undergoing fast changes in a shifting climate and may contribute significantly to future sea level rise. The physical properties of the ice sheets contain important information that can aid understanding of ice sheet dynamics (why they move) and provide hints on how ice sheets themselves respond to the changing climate. Therefore, making comprehensive observations of the time-dependent physical properties of the ice sheets is critical to better predict how much and how fast these systems will contribute to sea level rise. By leveraging existing seismic data, this project will aid the understanding of how seismic properties within and beneath the ice sheets change over time. Seasonal changes in subglacial conditions, revealed by seismic energy from remote earthquakes and ambient noise, are directly related to the evolution of subglacial hydrological systems. Targets of the research include near-surface seismic properties, which will reveal possible changes within and local conditions of the firn, a shallow layer used to understand long-term trends and improve regional climate models. Results from Antarctica will be compared to those from the Greenland ice sheet to isolate true seasonal signatures in the response of ice sheets in northern and southern polar regions to seasonal atmospheric and climate forcing. Further, sub-glacial solid Earth properties help constrain the geology of the ice-covered continent. In addition to the research efforts, the project will support a female graduate student, a female scientist and an early career (non-tenured) faculty, with additional educational efforts catering to the needs of K-12 and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nSeismic properties within and beneath Antarctic ice sheets reflect physical changes in firn and subglacial hydrological systems and thus contain information on how the ice sheets are changing now and may change in the future. Seismic ambient noise and teleseismic wave measurements display geographical and temporal variations of near-surface and deeper properties, described to date in polar regions such as Greenland. A systematic survey of temporal variations has not yet been performed across all of Antarctica. Preliminary findings suggest seasonal variations in seismic observations (e.g., up to ±20% annual shear velocity change), and initial comparisons between sensors and hemispheres suggest true physical changes within the ice sheet and at its base are being detected. This project will perform a comprehensive analysis of seismic data collected by more than 600 stations in Antarctica over the past two decades, focusing on seasonal and long-term temporal changes recorded in various data products from both body and surface waves. This project will investigate: 1) Body-wave receiver function waveform analysis and their vertical-to-horizontal initial amplitude ratio, a novel approach to investigate shear velocity in the top few meters to several km; 2) Surface wave analysis (horizontal-to-vertical ratios method using both ambient noise and teleseismic earthquakes); and 3) Ambient noise coda, which helps characterize subglacial hydrological systems. Notably, the first two measurements (horizontal-to-vertical ratios and radio-frequency amplitudes) will be incorporated in a novel method to constrain temporal changes in the top tens of meters of the ice sheet down to tens of kilometers depth, resolving the ice sheet base and crust below.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Part 1:  This project focuses on a group of ecologically important species of fishes which inhabit the frigid waters of Antarctica. They represent a key link in the polar food web as they are prey for penguins, seals and toothed whales. These fish have evolved in the constant, extreme cold for millions of years and therefore, are very sensitive to the increasing water temperatures associated with global warming. These studies will investigate the impacts of incremental heat exposure on the biology of these fishes by examining their ability to respond, or inability to respond, to elevated temperatures. The project will employ cutting-edge technology to examine responses at the cellular level that may help these environmentally sensitive fishes adapt to the challenges of global warming. The primary goal is to increase our collective understanding of how polar ecosystems are likely to be impacted in the coming decades.\r\n\r\nPart 2:  The proposed research is designed to use an existing bank of frozen tissues from a species of cold-adapted Antarctic fish to investigate protein-level responses to heat stress. These samples were collected earlier in the PI's career during fieldwork at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Four tissues (control as well as heat- stressed) will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize their proteome, defined as the entire complement of proteins in a sample. This includes both identification and quantification of these proteins. The goal is to determine what mechanisms of response to elevated temperature are available to the extremely cold-adapted, stenothermic fishes of Antarctica. Follow-up analyses will use immunoblotting (Western blotting) with antibodies specific to a sub-set of proteins revealed to be heat-responsive in the proteomic analyses. As this is a Mid-Career Advancement Award, training and mentorship in proteomic analyses for the PI will be supported, with time spent at the partner institution, the University of California, Davis. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nWhile there has been an increase in the use of genomic technologies to probe gene expression profiles in Antarctic species, few studies exist looking at protein level changes during exposure to heat stress in these organisms. Therefore, the proposed studies would represent a large leap forward in our understanding of how these environmentally sensitive species can, or cannot, respond at the cellular level as the Earth continues to warm and water temperatures rise. As proteins do the \"work\" in the cell, it's vital to understand which proteins are present and in what quantity and how dynamic this \"proteome\" is during stress. The proposed studies would provide this information for thousands of proteins, using already existing samples. The findings would be entirely novel and would allow us a much better picture of how animals that evolved in the cold for millions of years are likely to respond to climate change. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe PI has established relationships with several regional K-12 institutions and will continue to provide outreach in the form of classroom visits and the creation of classroom curricula. The PI has an on-going collaboration with the Oregon Coast Aquarium (Newport, OR) to create novel teaching materials for grades 6-8. The Aquarium has partners in surrounding school districts and will help disseminate videos about marine biology and climate change. Modules concerning polar species will be created under this proposal. An interactive website will be created demonstrating the Antarctic food web. All of the proteomic analyses and libraries generated under this award will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This study will investigate uranium (U) cycling in oxygen-depleted conditions on the ocean floor, the most important sink of U. Improving our understanding of U geochemistry is critical for geological applications as diverse as dating the age of rocks, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, water quality, and securing new critical mineral sources. Reconstructing the oxygen levels of ancient oceans helps to link the evolution of the environment with evolution of life on Earth and potentially on exoplanets. Interpreting tools to probe oxygen levels in the oceans through time, such as U and other elements sensitive to oxygen level, remain challenging because of the unknowns about how they behave in low-oxygen marine settings. To address this knowledge gap, this project will track the presence of a new U species, U(+V), and investigate its role in the U cycle in modern and ancient oceans. These results will provide important insights for reconstructions of oxygen of Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, as well as the global U cycle more broadly. \r\n\r\nThe host phases and speciation of U in marine settings remain largely unknown, hampering our ability to reconstruct depositional conditions. This project will investigate U burial in the most significant marine sink to characterize the relationship between U speciation, removal pathways, and whole-rock U geochemistry, including its isotope composition. This goal will be accomplished with: (1) experiments of U phases relevant to marine settings; (2) characterizing the relationship between U speciation and U geochemistry in organic-rich shales and sediments; and (3) developing an interpretive model to predict U geochemistry from contextual information. In addition to graduate training, this project will promote museum collections and science communication for Earth and environmental science majors and K-12 outreach in environmental geosciences in rural Pennsylvania and Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Plant communities respond to climate change by moving and changing, but current predictions lack mechanistic connections between plant function and environmental change. Plant community responses are observed repeatedly in the fossil record, and could help predict future changes by measuring traits from plant fossils. Much effort has focused on the ways that leaves respond to and record environmental conditions. However, leaves depend on long-lived organs, such as stems, to enable plant function. This study will establish a new database dedicated to plant stem traits from fossil xylem to understand plant community responses to major intervals of ancient climate change. More broadly, this project will prepare a new generation of Earth scientists for this highly interdisciplinary work and expand participation in research through training and mentoring targeted towards underrepresented groups in paleontology through the creation of a paleontology and ecosystem modeling short course. \r\n\r\nThis project is focused on assessing water transport in the xylem of Paleozoic and Mesozoic plants as an adaptation that influenced survivorship across two major intervals of climate change: the Late Paleozoic Ice Age of the Carboniferous-Permian (~300 million years ago [Ma]) and the hothouse climate of the Triassic-Jurassic (~200 Ma). This project will focus on three specific aims: (1) establish a unified xylem fossil functional anatomy database to facilitate (2) prediction of hydraulic traits for extinct taxa and (3) integration of fossil-observed leaf and xylem traits to predict whole-plant function using a modified ecosystem process model (Paleo-BGC). Investigators will use this approach to assess extinct plant water stress and ecosystem function through periods of extreme global climate change and test the hypothesis that coordination of leaf and stem water transport traits distinguished taxa as casualties, survivors, and thrivers during floral collapse and recovery during both global cooling and warming events. This project prioritizes training a new generation of interdisciplinary Earth scientists through training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars. Additionally, a short course for underrepresented and early career scientists focused on linking paleobotany, plant physiology, and climate change will be created. Pre- and post-course summative evaluations will be applied with an aim to improve future course iterations’ delivery of climate-change-focused interdisciplinary geoscience to the target audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This grant will fund the acquisition of instrumentation to support the growth of undergraduate research and education in Environmental Biogeochemistry and Mineralogy at La Salle University as well as promote collaboration for undergraduate research in the Philadelphia region. A Rigaku MiniFlex 6G X-ray diffractometer and an IXRF Iridium Ultra Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy System will enable mineralogical and chemical analysis to understand the cycling of metals between water, minerals, and biota. This information can help inform technologies aimed at treating environmental contaminants. This equipment acquisition will benefit science discovery and society by providing insights into biogeochemical cycling processes which in turn can improve treatment and remediation of environmental contaminants.  Increase of student engagement by providing access and training to this equipment in course work and research projects will enhance undergraduate education across Environmental Science, Biology and Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation purchased with this award will be used to examine (1) how airborne fungi produce calcium-containing minerals (2) ways for toxic lead to be stabilized in Philadelphia soils, and (3) how mineral co-precipitation of barite can remove toxic arsenic and chromium from wastewaters produced from oil and gas operations. In particular, X-ray diffraction will be used to identify minerals produced by fungi in laboratory cultures, minerals in soils collected around contaminated sites in Philadelphia, and minerals co-precipitated with contaminants from simulated fracking wastewaters. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy will be used to map the incorporation of metals into bio-precipitated minerals with fungal biomass, the location of lead in soil minerals and plants grown in contaminated soils, and to map the distribution of arsenic and chromium in barite mineral particles produced from simulated wastewater treatments. Collaborations will also be developed across the Philadelphia region with a focus on affordable, undergraduate access to instrumentation for research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This instrument will have a wide range of users with diverse backgrounds, including those in hydrogeology, paleoenvironmental studies, and solid earth processes. The acquisition of this new instrument will benefit all levels of education at multiple institutions, as well as provide opportunities for public outreach. Student-led undergraduate research using this instrument through several undergraduate STEM-focused training programs at Syracuse University will be promoted. Use of this instrument will highlight this instrument as an example of state-of-the-art analytical work in Earth Sciences when interacting with underrepresented groups. Syracuse K-12 students will have opportunities to tour the ICP-MS laboratory. The instrument capabilities will be showcased through videos broadly disseminated. \r\n\r\nThe ICP-MS  instrument  measures carbonate iodine to calcium ratios for investigating changes in ocean oxygen patterns through geologic history. These changes recorded in global oceans reflect important environmental changes in the atmosphere, on land and during the evolution of life. Data generated from analyzing samples with this instrument will be compared to Earth system model results and will help constraint future models. The PIs will further develop halogens as hydrogeochemical tracers for both groundwater and surface water applications. The partitioning of iodine between environmentally important minerals (e.g. carbonate and apatite) and aqueous solutions will also be examined. This ICP-MS will be integrated into all levels of established curriculum, which will reach students from lower and upper division undergraduates to graduate students both in person and online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and the second largest in the world, is big enough to make its own weather.  The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).\r\n\r\nThe work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.  Rainfall is a hazard as well as a resource given that much of the rain falls in severe storms, a particular hazard for the fishing fleet.  The PIs conduct public outreach regarding climate change in the region through a traveling museum exhibit to be presented at the Mayborn Museum at Baylor University and at the National Museum of Kenya.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin and one at Baylor University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "South Carolina State University (SCSU), in collaboration with over seventeen other academic institutions in South Carolina and Geogia, will organize a 1.5 days-long conference in Savannah, GA that will bring together a diverse constellation of academic, public, and private sector representatives to build leadership, enhance partnerships, and improve the capacity of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and women-only colleges in South Carolina and Georgia to diversify, strengthen, and expand a rapidly evolving geoscience workforce. Outcomes of the conference will include a report outlining gaps, challenges, and opportunities linked to preparing students at participating institutions for diverse geoscience career pathways. The report will include recommendations for academia, public, and private sectors to address those gaps, challenges, and opportunities. This project will launch the foundation for a community of practice that continues to learn and share good practices and ideas, beyond the award period.\r\n\r\nThe conference organizers will bring together faculty and administrators from HBCUs and women-only institutions in SC and GA, funding-agency representatives, and employers in private and public sectors. The goal of the conference is to 1) identify curriculum gaps and challenges linked to lack of preparation for students for geoscience jobs, 2) develop recommendations for participating institutions, employers and funding agencies to address the gaps and challenges, and 3) lay the groundwork for future collaborations.

         "The National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM), in operation since 2003, is a facility jointly operated by the University of Houston and the University of California Berkeley. NCALM provides airborne laser scanning surveys, high-resolution airborne digital images, and data processing expertise to the earth science community for the creation of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) data of Earth’s surface (topography), the built-environment, and vegetation. These 3D data are used by scientists to study natural processes such as landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, the modeling of flood behavior, and storage of atmospheric carbon in forests, among many applications. NCALM is focused on three primary goals: 1) train and educate graduate students to meet the needs of industry, government, and academia; 2) advance technology that allows for the creation of high-resolution and high-accuracy 3D data; and 3) provide research-quality 3D digital data to the scientific community.\r\n \r\nUnder the current award, NCALM will continue providing the research community with research-quality elevation data of Earth’s surface (topography, vegetation, and shallow water bathymetry) and digital aerial imaging.  A key contribution of the facility has been the Seed project program for which graduate students from US institutions prepare proposals to request lidar data for their thesis or dissertation.  These requests are competitively evaluated by an independent committee based on intellectual merit and broader impacts.  NCALM will pilot activities aimed at increasing participation in the Seed program by students from minority serving institutions (MSIs). These activities include a workshop to solicit input from MSI geoscience faculty, establishment of a short-term MSI faculty-in-residence program at NCALM, and encouraging Seed project applications from underrepresented minorities. With the accelerating effects of climate change and the increase in natural hazards in the US, there is a need to rapidly acquire high-resolution topography data immediately after an extreme event. In response to this evolving need, NCALM will pilot an \"NCALM NOW\" service through which researchers can request surveys to quickly acquire perishable data immediately after events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In this Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project, the PI will join a team of researchers at the University of California Irvine in order to study the properties of ultrafine aerosol emissions from brake wear via laboratory experiments and a small-scale filter-based field campaign. Aerosol emissions from brake wear has recently been identified as a major contributor to non-exhaust related emissions from the transportation sector and with the ongoing shift to electric vehicles, the relative important of non-exhaust emissions are of growing importance. The PI will additionally collaborate with a local nonprofit organization working towards improved air quality and cleaner air as well as collaborate with filmmakers in order to produce bilingual (English and Spanish) science education videos related to this research. \r\n\r\nThe work includes three research questions: (1) What are the physiochemical properties of ultrafine particles formed from break wear? (2) How do these properties change after undergoing secondary atmospheric processing including oxidation and photodegradation? (3) Are ultrafine particles from brake wear present in ambient samples from Santa Ana, California? There are three main research approaches: (1) laboratory experiments on the formation of ultrafine particles from brake emissions; (2) the use of an oxidation flow reactor to characterize the formation of secondary species; and (3) the collection of ultrafine particles generated from brake wear emissions on filters within Santa Ana, California, and the study of their chemistry via exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Multiple instruments will be used during this project including various mass spectrometers as well as a transmission electron microscope.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Various plasma waves are excited in near-Earth space during geomagnetic storms, and the waves affect the behavior of particles carrying the ring current and the strength of the flux of energetic electrons in the radiation belts.  Ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves with frequencies below 100 mHz play an essential role in this regard, and understanding the spatial and temporal occurrence patterns and the excitation mechanism of the waves is a crucial element in magnetospheric research. The investigation focuses on a recently reported new type of compressional ULF waves in the inner magnetosphere with a symmetric (fundamental) mode structure about the magnetic equator. Antisymmetric (second harmonic) waves are commonly detected and well-documented in the literature.  The team aims to determine the relevance of drift compressional instability (DCI) to stormtime magnetospheric ULF waves. The investigation has broader impacts regarding wave-particle interactions occurring on other planets and in laboratory plasmas.  In addition, the investigation will contribute to building improved space weather models that are valuable beyond the context of basic research.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the investigation is to observationally determine whether the physical properties of symmetric ULF waves and the particle environment associated with the symmetric waves are consistent with DCI.  To this end, we will use data from the Van Allen Probes (RBSP), which include electric and magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles. With the RBSP mission providing measurements in the inner magnetosphere ( < 6) over a 7-year period (2012–2019), the data are ideal for determining the mode structure of ULF waves, their spatial and temporal distributions, and the properties of the background particles.  We will determine the mode structure by paying attention to the relation between the spacecraft latitude and the location of the equatorial node/antinode of ULF waves. The relevance of DCI to observed symmetric waves will be discussed by evaluating the theoretical instability condition using observationally determined energy and radial distance dependence of the phase space density of ions in the ring current energy range (1-300 keV). We will discuss the statistically determined spatial occurrence pattern of the waves in relation to the drift of ions injected from a nightside source region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to advance knowledge of tsunami hazards along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the main source for earthquakes and tsunamis  in the US Pacific Northwest. This work will map ancient tsunami deposits preserved in the geologic record and combine this data with advanced models to simulate tsunami impacts along the coast. These results will deepen understanding of how past earthquakes have behaved in this region. The specific focus will be on the last major earthquake in the region that occurred in the year 1700. This research will directly impact public safety and preparedness in the region. The insights gained will help to improve hazard maps, emergency and evacuation plans, building codes, and the design of tsunami evacuation structures. Furthermore, the project will support a collaboration with the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. This tribe has built North America's first free-standing tsunami evacuation tower, and the collaboration will help to advance community engagement and education regarding seismic risks. Through ths work, this project will serve as a vital investment in public safety and knowledge dissemination. \r\n  \r\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ), focusing on the seismic and tsunami activity around the year 1700 CE. To accomplish this, the team will carry out high-resolution mapping of paleotsunami deposits at two key locations along the CSZ and execute thousands of advanced tsunami inundation models. These efforts aim to test various hypotheses of what kinds of earthquake slip distributions can explain actual field observations, addressing gaps in the current understanding of tsunami deposit distribution. By employing innovative techniques such as analyzing sediment cores, microfossils, and sediment geochemistry, the results will delineate the full extent of tsunami inundation with high resolution at these new sites. This approach will help in validating or excluding different earthquake scenarios and contribute to a more precise understanding of the CSZ's seismic behavior. This research is fundamental for accurate seismic and tsunami mapping and has wide-ranging implications for practical hazard applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to advance knowledge of tsunami hazards along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the main source for earthquakes and tsunamis  in the US Pacific Northwest. This work will map ancient tsunami deposits preserved in the geologic record and combine this data with advanced models to simulate tsunami impacts along the coast. These results will deepen understanding of how past earthquakes have behaved in this region. The specific focus will be on the last major earthquake in the region that occurred in the year 1700. This research will directly impact public safety and preparedness in the region. The insights gained will help to improve hazard maps, emergency and evacuation plans, building codes, and the design of tsunami evacuation structures. Furthermore, the project will support a collaboration with the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. This tribe has built North America's first free-standing tsunami evacuation tower, and the collaboration will help to advance community engagement and education regarding seismic risks. Through ths work, this project will serve as a vital investment in public safety and knowledge dissemination. \r\n  \r\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ), focusing on the seismic and tsunami activity around the year 1700 CE. To accomplish this, the team will carry out high-resolution mapping of paleotsunami deposits at two key locations along the CSZ and execute thousands of advanced tsunami inundation models. These efforts aim to test various hypotheses of what kinds of earthquake slip distributions can explain actual field observations, addressing gaps in the current understanding of tsunami deposit distribution. By employing innovative techniques such as analyzing sediment cores, microfossils, and sediment geochemistry, the results will delineate the full extent of tsunami inundation with high resolution at these new sites. This approach will help in validating or excluding different earthquake scenarios and contribute to a more precise understanding of the CSZ's seismic behavior. This research is fundamental for accurate seismic and tsunami mapping and has wide-ranging implications for practical hazard applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to develop a vibrant geoscience learning ecosystem designed to increase the number and diversity of undergraduate students pursuing geosciences careers. Representation of historically excluded groups in the geosciences continues to be substantially below whole population representation, despite the many programs designed to close this gap. Particularly troubling is the gap in representation of Black environmental- and geo-scientists. The Waterways for Environmental Science – Promoting Advancement and Training through Hands-on Supports (WES-PATHS) project is designed to increase post-secondary student parity in the geosciences, while researching underlying questions that should inform recruitment and retention, career readiness and vocational discernment. WES-PATHS will build a relationship between area high schools and North Carolina Wesleyan College (NCWU), providing high school students, teachers, and counselors with more accessible opportunities to explore the pursuit of higher education in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nThe goal of WES-PATHS is to support workforce development and diversity in the geosciences by increasing the number of students majoring and minoring in Environmental Science (ES) at NCWU, with an emphasis on increasing recruitment and retention of students from historically excluded groups. To achieve this goal, this program will: (1) target outreach and recruitment of prospective students from nine high schools in the Rocky Mount area, many with majority minority student bodies; (2) develop a geoscience learning ecosystem that begins in high school and follows students through a first-year orientation, with faculty and near-peer mentorship throughout their first year; (3) build skills and competency for career readiness through either a research internship or professional externship; (4) encourage self-efficacy and belonging in ES students through field and lab experiences; and (5) use project-based learning with direct stakeholder engagement to address issues of local water quality and quantity. By integrating activities and creating a supportive environment that begins more than a semester before students matriculate, this project seeks to lower barriers to recruitment, retention, and graduation to support a more diverse student body prepared to enter the regional workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In this research project, the PI will study the physical and chemical processes that control stratospheric aerosols which will advance our ability to characterize and understand phenomena associated with volcanic emissions and their resultant climate and chemistry impacts. There is a clear need to better understand stratospheric aerosol processes and this work will address existing data gaps related to new particle formation in the stratosphere. Specifically, the three data gaps to be addressed in this work are: (1) What are the key parameters that control new particle formation in the stratosphere and how extendible are the existing tropospheric models to stratospheric conditions? (2) What are the underlying microphysical and transport processes that lead to the observed aerosol properties that are not captured by existing models? (3) What are possible explanations for the shorter-than-observed model simulated stratospheric aerosol lifetime after major volcanic eruptions? \r\n\r\nThese data gaps will be addressed via the following tasks. First, new mechanisms of particle nucleation in the stratosphere will be developed. Second, the processes which lead to the observed bimodal structure in accumulation mode particles in the stratosphere that are currently not captured in models will be studied. Third, potential reasons for faster-than-observed reductions in post-volcanic sulfate mass burdens in current models will be examined. The results and new parameterizations will be implemented via an Advanced Particle Microphysics model within the widely used GEOS-Chem model. This project will support and train a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate, and an undergraduate student, plus provide research experience for underrepresented high school senior students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is crucial to the U.S. health and economy, yet retention rates in STEM fields are poor, and the geoscience community in particular is faced with a looming workforce shortage. Moreover, the geoscience community continues to lack the diversity of the population at large. The STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS) project is a partnership between the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, University of California Berkeley, Morgan State University and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) aimed at addressing three priorities: (1) increasing the number and diversity of students pursuing degrees and careers in geosciences; (2) preparing students for many career trajectories in the geosciences and beyond; and, (3) contributing to the evidence base for effective student engagement, learning and retention in STEM. The STEMSEAS project will achieve these goals by taking advantage of unused berthing capacity available on UNOLS and other oceanographic research vessels as they transit between ports in preparation for their next scientific expedition. These short (~6-10 day) transits offer a unique mobile classroom setting where undergraduate students can be exposed to geoscience professional practice and career exploration. While at sea, students engage in a variety of hands-on activities that incorporate science content, lab exercises, data collection/analysis, and career exploration. The project will organize four expeditions per year for students selected from across the US and for faculty at US two-year colleges (2YC) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).\r\n\r\nSTEMSEAS has demonstrated that it is a robust mechanism for geoscience discovery and STEM ecosystem development. This project aims to expand this progress while improving its reach and effectiveness through a combination of diversified leadership team, integrated professional development for HBCU and 2YC faculty, research in transformative learning, and leadership opportunities for student alumni. STEMSEAS will add to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of immersive at-sea experiences to students’ inspiration and retention in the geosciences, their comfort level with geoscience knowledge, and their familiarity with geoscience career pathways. It will also contribute to the body of knowledge about the components of real transformative learning experiences. The project assists the academic fleet in its mission to cultivate the next generation of geoscience researchers and workforce. By taking students from communities that have historically been poorly represented in geoscience on mentored transits aboard these state-of-the-art vessels, the project stands to have profound impact on individual students. By establishing the partnerships and process by which students have access to ship time, this project sets the stage for increasing numbers of students and universities over time.

In addition, STEMSEAS has established several channels for broader impacts in the science research and 2YC community through inviting “pocket” science projects at targets of opportunity along ship tracks and increasing research capacity at smaller institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is crucial to the U.S. health and economy, yet retention rates in STEM fields are poor, and the geoscience community in particular is faced with a looming workforce shortage. Moreover, the geoscience community continues to lack the diversity of the population at large. The STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS) project is a partnership between the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, University of California Berkeley, Morgan State University and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) aimed at addressing three priorities: (1) increasing the number and diversity of students pursuing degrees and careers in geosciences; (2) preparing students for many career trajectories in the geosciences and beyond; and, (3) contributing to the evidence base for effective student engagement, learning and retention in STEM. The STEMSEAS project will achieve these goals by taking advantage of unused berthing capacity available on UNOLS and other oceanographic research vessels as they transit between ports in preparation for their next scientific expedition. These short (~6-10 day) transits offer a unique mobile classroom setting where undergraduate students can be exposed to geoscience professional practice and career exploration. While at sea, students engage in a variety of hands-on activities that incorporate science content, lab exercises, data collection/analysis, and career exploration. The project will organize four expeditions per year for students selected from across the US and for faculty at US two-year colleges (2YC) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).\r\n\r\nSTEMSEAS has demonstrated that it is a robust mechanism for geoscience discovery and STEM ecosystem development. This project aims to expand this progress while improving its reach and effectiveness through a combination of diversified leadership team, integrated professional development for HBCU and 2YC faculty, research in transformative learning, and leadership opportunities for student alumni. STEMSEAS will add to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of immersive at-sea experiences to students’ inspiration and retention in the geosciences, their comfort level with geoscience knowledge, and their familiarity with geoscience career pathways. It will also contribute to the body of knowledge about the components of real transformative learning experiences.

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is a new ultra low-cost carbon-oxygen battery that provides high energy density long-duration storage with unique fundamental properties needed to enable 100% renewable energy. This closed-loop stationary energy storage system will turn intermittent solar/wind power into on-demand power at lower cost than fossil fuel generation. Additionally, its high energy density (3x lighter and smaller than Lithium-ion batteries at system level) will enable longer range electric ships, trucks, etc. – a secondary target market – and a much more compact size for stationary storage than other batteries at the same energy capacity. The project will provide insight into the scale-up potential and design parameters of key battery components. Achieving 100% sustainable energy will have a wide range of societal impacts including minimizing environmental impact and improving human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project for the carbon-oxygen battery will thus focus on key technology development of the core components by modeling, building, and testing. This will involve assembling an array of small-scale prototype reactors to screen configurations and iterate on the design, followed by scale up to a larger megawatt-hour (MWh) scale reactors to integrate into a demo system.  The objectives of the Phase II project will focus on optimizing the reactor to achieve the key target metrics, including objectives to: 1) create and validate a multi-physics model of the optimized reactor, 2) design the optimized reactor, operating conditions, and materials, and 3) build and test several optimized reactors and show that the best design has the potential to fulfill the target metrics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In reinforced concrete buildings, cast-in-place floor slabs, or “diaphragms”, must resist both gravity loads, the weight of the structure and building contents, and horizontal loads, caused by wind or the inertia of the floors during earthquakes. For the building to function, these floor diaphragms also must contain openings for stairs, elevators, and mechanical systems. Although the presence of these openings is accounted for when designing the structure for gravity loads, there is little research or understanding of how they affect the building’s behavior during earthquake loading. The potential consequences of this lack of understanding were recently demonstrated during earthquake simulator tests on a five-story reinforced concrete building. Unexpected diaphragm damage during testing indicates that openings adjacent to walls and columns contribute to collapse risk and could preclude or delay the return of a building’s functionality after a seismic event. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings and develop tools for their design and for probabilistically quantifying their expected performance during an earthquake. The research will be complemented by an online class curriculum focusing on accurate simulation approaches and their validation, for both students and practitioners, as part of the recently established earthquake engineering certificate program and outreach to engage underrepresented minority and first-generation college students in research.\r\n\r\nThis award will focus on advancing science-based tools and technologies, through simulation-driven experimental testing and nonlinear finite element analysis of prototype buildings under multiple hazard intensities, for the collapse-resistant and recovery-based earthquake engineering of cast-in-place concrete diaphragms with openings. This research will investigate (1) accurate load paths, including fanned collection patterns from regions of low stress to struts, which form the primary load path; (2) the impact of openings and establishing protected zones to mitigate damage that could lead to partial collapse; and (3) damage states and fragility curves that quantify diaphragm performance for inclusion in functional recovery methodologies. Several fundamental research questions will be answered, including (1) what is the inertial load path through the diaphragm, and how are these load paths affected by openings; (2) how does the slab thickness, reinforcement, and the presence of openings affect the capacity of diaphragm elements subjected to complex in-plane stresses; (3) how does the presence of openings modify the effective stiffness of diaphragms, and what is the effect on engineering demand parameters; (4) what is the relationship between engineering demand parameters, ground motion intensity measures, and diaphragm damage; and (5) how does diaphragm damage around openings affect safety, story access, and tenet functionality. Equally important, this project will form the foundation for additional research to fully investigate the lateral force resisting system, including slab-wall and slab-column connections, using pseudo-dynamic and earthquake simulator testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Immediately after a major hazard event (e.g., wildfire, earthquake, flood), a prompt assessment of the geographic distribution and severity of infrastructure damage is vital to the success of the emergency response and early recovery planning. This situational awareness is an important part of the decision-making processes that are implemented by facility owners, users, emergency responders and local and state officials. Conversely, a general lack of knowledge about the impacted state of the built environment can lead to a disorganized public response and slower recovery. While a comprehensive assessment of the extent and distribution of infrastructure damage can be obtained from in-person inspections conducted by building professionals, depending on the scale of the event, this can be a lengthy, resource intensive process. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will address this challenge by utilizing principles from artificial intelligence (AI) to develop near real-time infrastructure damage prediction models that can process and utilize different types of data and information (e.g., images, text, tabular data). By advancing our ability to effectively integrate disparate information sources, this project aims to transform the way that physical damage to infrastructure is estimated in the aftermath of a major disaster event, thereby enhancing the emergency response and recovery planning phases that follow. The research will provide training for doctoral and masters students and an opportunity to teach undergraduates from different backgrounds how science and engineering coupled with AI technologies can be used to improve community response to extreme events.\r\n\r\nFundamental concepts and methodological advancements in multimodal learning will be used to transform and enhance infrastructure damage prediction models for use in the immediate post-event environment. The state-of-the-art in image-based damage assessment will be advanced along two dimensions: (1) developing Vision Transformer-based methods and (2) establishing a self-supervised learning methodology for training the models using large collections of unlabeled data. A new knowledge base will be established around the broad area of multimodal data fusion for infrastructure damage prediction models. Specific questions regarding unified representation, translation across and alignment between modalities and data fusion will be answered. A new type of hazard-agnostic infrastructure damage prediction model will also emerge from this research. Such a model will have the ability to receive an integrated representation of one or more types of input modalities (i.e., image, text, and engineering/tabular data) and produce, as output, an infrastructure damage level that is agnostic to the type of causal event (e.g., earthquake or hurricane). Using a comprehensive data set from multiple natural hazard events (hurricane and earthquake), the project will include experiments to shed new light on the ability of both hazard-specific and hazard-agnostic multimodal models to enhance early-stage infrastructure damage assessments for increased situational awareness and enhanced resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to serve the national interest by producing more qualified technicians to meet workforce demands in cybersecurity. Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge in business, industry, and government. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect both existing and emerging technologies. This project will prepare students for cybersecurity technician positions by engaging with employers to strengthen the technical experience that students gain during their courses. The project will also focus on increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation of students from underrepresented groups and will thereby improve the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\nBased at Cypress College, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), this project will build on a previous NSF-funded project, called \"PACE: Pathway to Advance Cybersecurity Education\" (NSF Award DUE-1902519), which developed a pathway from high school (as early as 9th grade) with multiple educational and employment exit points. The new project, known as \"ACE IDEAS: Advanced Cybersecurity Education for Industry-driven, Diversity-minded, Early Aged Students,\" has two main goals: (1) update and augment the PACE cybersecurity courses to include project-based learning, internships, soft skills, and focused preparation for industry certification exams and (2) build program enrollment, persistence, and completion through activities with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups. In particular, the investigators will work closely with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) to align the curriculum with the needs of employers, develop internships, and integrate project-based learning. Other activities will include developing an ePortfolio system for students, developing an industry mentorship program for students, engaging high school students in CyberPatriot and other competitions, and offering workshops on inclusive practices to high school teachers and counselors and college faculty. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is in the development of a visual unilateral neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation tool for stroke patients.  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability, including the cost of healthcare services, medicines and missed days of work. Stroke related costs in the United States are around $50 billion every year. Unilateral spatial neglect (neglect) is a disabling neurocognitive impairment for stroke patients occurring in 28.60% of the stroke population.  Moreover, neglect is a strong predictor of disability, and stroke patients with neglect have longer hospital stays and receive more direct treatment time from physical and occupational therapists than individuals without neglect, culminating in significantly higher healthcare costs.  However, there is currently no commercial product targeting neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation. Current clinical gold standard neglect detection methods are affected by compensatory strategies and are not sensitive to changes in the severity of neglect; and rehabilitation techniques are not effective in reducing disability associated with neglect.  This project, through a multidisciplinary team, will address these issues while developing the proposed neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation tool that incorporates stimulation to draw attention to the affected side of the body and environment based on the automatic detection of neglect through neurophysiology measured through electroencephalography, thereby stimulating neural networks responsible for spatial attention and perceptual processing for stroke patients. Stimulation during everyday activities with high levels of repetition is needed to promote implicit learning that supports generalization of learning and independence.  Current detection and rehabilitation methods lack the necessary precision, salience, and repetition to promote this type of learning. Due to limitations associated with these methods, there is no gold assessment for neglect or standard of care for rehabilitation of neglect in routine clinical practice. The proposed project offers a potential solution to these problems, incorporating best practices from rehabilitation intervention research and state-of-the-art technologies that will be cost-effective to be implemented in rehabilitation clinics. The proposed technology incorporates objective and reliable quantification of neglect severity and tailored sensory stimulation that is: (i) technology-driven (accurate, reliable, repetitive, cost-effective); (ii) multimodal: visual, auditory, haptic stimulation (optimizes perceptual processing); (iii) individualized to the available field of vision; and (iv) simultaneous with ``real-world'' activities of daily living .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Barrier-island communities face flooding due to rising sea levels and stronger storms, and typical adaptations (protect, accommodate, retreat) may not keep up with increasing risks. Communities are now considering extreme adaptations, such as allowing an island section to ‘return to nature’ by removing roadways and other infrastructure. But these extreme adaptations transform the natural processes of and the community’s relationship with barriers. The effects on flood risks at nearby communities are not well understood, and it is not clear whether communities will ‘welcome the water’ or reject it as opposing their sense of place. This Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project explores participatory transformation of barriers. Stakeholders will provide insights on place meanings across the barrier island and how floods affect these places and their connections to the community. The project also quantifies how flooding at a natural island section may change the hazard at neighboring communities, and whether these locations can be selected to minimize the risks while maximizing community attachments. These activities provide a framework for participatory transformation, as well as advance technologies for flood risk modeling that can be expanded to improve disaster resilience for communities along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts. This research also supports an immersive experience for students to collaborate across engineering and social-science disciplines to tackle the challenges of climate change.\r\n\r\nThis Disaster Resilience Research Grant project advances understanding of how local erosion events contribute to floods at neighboring communities; how these floods can be managed by allowing barrier sections to return to nature; and how such a transformation, when informed and deliberated by community stakeholders, may affect community place meanings. The research will be organized on the following objectives: (O1) identify ‘acceptable’ locations for extreme adaptation of barrier systems; (O2) quantify reductions in flood risk from extreme adaptations at ‘acceptable’ and other locations; and (O3) assess changes in stakeholders’ perceptions about extreme adaptation techniques for barrier islands. Via high-resolution modeling of flooding subject to possible barrier configurations and future climate scenarios, this project quantifies the scales of flooding at neighboring communities. And via science co-production, this project investigates how the community’s attachment to the barrier island may be increased if stakeholders take an active role in the transformation. This project uses transformative research approaches and engagement to facilitate new approaches to community-led management and adaptation of barriers, enable improved efforts to plan for the consequences of landform changes and development, and advance the integration of the coastal science, engineering, and adaptation disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Geoscience as a profession is at a crossroads with respect to attracting individuals from diverse populations and training future geoscientists. Western Oregon University (WOU) will develop a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem, which is a collaborative partnership between a four-year public university, natural resource focused government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and regional geoscience employers. The goal of the partnership is to cultivate Earth science literacy and motivate novel solutions to local environmental issues, while connecting diverse student populations to the geoscience discipline with altruistic motivations for pursuing future careers as professionals. The project will engage and invigorate a new generation of geoscience professionals, particularly those who have been structurally excluded in the sciences. Existing elements of WOU’s Earth and Environmental Science program will be strengthened with the intentional cultivation of an enhanced Geo-STEM learning ecosystem that provides professional mentorship and career-outreach experiences, designed to increase awareness of opportunities for professional outcomes in early career undergraduates who otherwise lack access. \r\n\r\nThe overarching project goal is to strengthen a Geo-STEM learning ecosystem and engage more young people in geosciences at the undergraduate level. The project will focus on mentored geoscience education through development of community water resource partnerships. Given that water resources and river restoration are iconic scientific themes in the Pacific Northwest, the WOU GEOPAths project team has adapted fundamental concepts of floodplain connectivity to the Geo-STEM learning ecosystem model, with the analogous intent of increasing connections between early career undergraduates to the geoscience profession. Specific objectives include: (1) increasing enrollment, diversity, and retention in the geosciences; (2) strengthening the statewide Geo-STEM learning ecosystem by fortifying connections to the professional community; and (3) testing novel approaches to recruitment of diverse populations in the geoscience profession. Extra-curricular experiences and training in the geosciences with a focus on service-learning and workforce training will lead to increased probabilities for student engagement, academic success, and positive career outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project seeks to build a cross-region innovative research group focused on equitable educational innovations to support historically excluded middle and high school youth–Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC), female-identifying youth, and youth in Title I schools or rural underserved districts–to develop embodied pathways to participation in geosciences communities. The key project activity will be the creation of a practitioner research group composed of community stakeholders, teachers, geoscience faculty, and educational community partners. This group will collaborate to develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation pathways for supporting historically excluded youth in geoscience communities of practice through hands-on fieldwork experiences and digital reflections. The stakeholders will form goals, identify success measures, and work to expand their program’s goals through developing a shared understanding around what equitable participation trajectories look like across similar domains.\r\n\r\nThe effects of underserved youth being excluded from the geosciences is readily reflected in the field however, less is known about the experiences of these youth in such trajectories and how geosciences educational stakeholders could redesign pathways to better serve the students. This project will use methods of community design research to 1) develop a shared professional vision around equitable participation in geoscience fieldwork; 2) develop shared best practices for facilitating more equitable participation in geosciences fieldwork and disciplinary conversations; and 3) support network partners in redesigning programs to set and meet expansive goals in this regard. Over the course of the project, the PI team will build a network of geosciences instructors and practitioners and work on iterative cycles of expanding their programmatic goals in alignment with the five key areas for the following outcomes: 1) Grounded fun; 2) STEM capital; 3) STEM trajectories; 4) STEM identity work; and 5) Agency.\r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There are many types of plasma waves in the Earth's magnetosphere.  For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  \r\n1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?\r\n2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?\r\n3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?\r\n4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?\r\n\r\nThe team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.

         "General abstract\r\n\r\nMost organisms alternate between life stages that vary in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes, in the number of cells they possess, and in the environmental conditions in which they are best adapted to live. Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research. The investigators will take advantage of an existing program to include high school or undergraduate students in the work which will also expand mentorship experience for the postdoc. All team members will contribute by writing for blogs produced by professional societies for the public.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nExisting macroalgal taxa samples from across a latitudinal gradient in the western Antarctic Peninsula will be used to explore patterns of genetic diversity from the center to the southern latitudinal limits of their range. Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The general science goal of the research is to advance understanding of feedback from cloud and moist convection to carbon dioxide radiative forcing, which is one of the most fundamental questions in modern climate science. \r\n\r\nThis project specifically seeks to advance several key aspects of climate modeling and future climate projections by identifying model parameters that can reproduce both past and present-day sea surface temperature gradients and north-south precipitation delta-deuterium gradients.  \r\n\r\nThe rational for the research strategy is founded on the notion that the reduction in the tropical to mid-latitude sea surface temperature gradient, as shown by proxy records across Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, is a common feature of past warm intervals but remains difficult for climate models to replicate. This model-data discrepancy (termed “the low-gradient problem”) is closely tied to the parameterizations of cloud, moist convection, and ocean mixing, which remain highly uncertain and limit the confidence of predicted future climate change by models. Narrowing down this uncertainty can benefit from data from past climates and targeted paleoclimate simulations.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts of this project include supporting early career scientists, post-doctoral scholar, graduate student, and undergraduate support and mentoring, and workshops for high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Equity in STEM is a critical part of collaboration. The overall goal of this RCN: Diversity in Ecology, Evolution, Marine Science, and Disease (RCN: DEEMD) is to promote collaboration and equity in ecology, evolution, marine science (EEMS) and the emerging infectious disease (EID) fields. These fields overlap in many different places, yet formal collaborative efforts need to be in place to facilitate equitable interactions. RCN:DEEMD aims to bridge both basic and social science approaches by 1) facilitating in-person workshops, 2) developing virtual working groups, 3) establishing and maintaining a mentorship program, and 4) generating a framework for more equity in approaches to EEMS and EID research. Early career training is provided through webinars and seminars to support training, professional development, laboratory exchanges, and career preparation. Assessments are done through surveys for the overall RCN, the in person workshops, and the mentorship program. Products from RCN: DEEMD are being widely disseminated through and other communication platforms.\r\n\r\nClimate change and other human induced stressors can cause an increase of pathogens spreading between wildlife and humans. EIDs can have devastating consequences on biodiversity while also highlighting the health inequities experienced in human populations world wide. Globally, EIDs often disproportionately affect marginalized and impoverished human populations. Such disparities start long before peak disease outbreaks and extend to interactions with wildlife. Therefore, it is critical to understand the underlying ecological, and evolutionary context of disease dynamics and their impact on vulnerable wildlife and human populations. However, to accomplish this, there needs to be more equity and diversity in the scientists that are studying this very large issue. Through the development of RCN: DEEMD investigation of the intersection of basic science and social science in EIDs is being achieved by integrating approaches from EEMS. Diverse research collaborations from underrepresented groups are being elevated to help develop a better structure for integrative communication to tackle such a large issue.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, Division of Environmental Biology, and Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "FTIR imaging microscopes provide a way for chemists to do rapid, non-destructive, chemical analyses of a wide variety of minerals, glasses and materials, with resolution down to one-quarter the width of a human hair. FTIR stands for Fourier Transform Infrared — the microscopes work their magic by exploiting the vibrational absorptions of chemical compounds in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The materials being studied in this project include volcanic glasses, to better understand Earth’s cycling of carbon dioxide and water, and micro-plastics, to identify pollution sources, sinks, and pathways. The proposed instrument is the LUMOS-II imaging microscope, a state-of-the-art instrument from Brüker that won the GOLD Award for the best new scientific instrument at Pittcon 2020, an annual conference showcasing advances in analytical research and scientific instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe new instrumentation will enable a wide range of applications, including 1) distribution of volatiles in mantle sources and their fluxes in mid-ocean ridge, ocean island, and subduction environments, 2) origin and evolution of volatiles in tephra and melt inclusions with emphasis on eruption dynamics, and 3) studies of environmental microplastics in Tampa Bay and beyond, contributing to a comprehensive study of pollutants in the region’s water, sediments, and biota. The FTIR imaging microscope is a remarkably robust instrument that will allow students to rapidly obtain high-resolution datasets. Funding is included to enable undergraduate students to travel to, or virtual participation in, annual conferences of professional societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are an expected consequence of rising greenhouse gas levels, and the past several decades have seen a dramatic increase in global SST.  But the eastern tropical Pacific has not warmed as expected despite substantial West Pacific warming.  The reasons for the absence of East Pacific warming are not clear and the lack of warming stands in contrast to the SST trend patterns in model simulations, which typically show an El Nino-like pattern with greater warming to the east.  The opposition between observed and simulated Pacific trend patterns has attracted considerable interest among climate scientists, as the warming pattern matters for both regional climate impacts and the overall amount of warming caused by greenhouse gas increases.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here seeks to understand the physical mechanisms that account for the difference in Pacific warming patterns between simulations and observations.  The project involves comparisons between full-complexity climate models and the Zebiak-Cane (ZC) model, a highly idealized atmosphere-ocean model built to capture the basic dynamics of El Nino.  The model produces an SST trend pattern similar to the observations and thus provides an important point of reference for understanding the physical mechanisms that produce the pattern.  The work involves adding mechanisms to the ZC model and disabling the same mechanisms in a full-complexity climate model to understand the effects of particular mechanisms.  A key consideration is the role of mean state bias in the simulated pattern, as earlier work suggests that simulations produce an incorrect trend pattern due to a well-known \"cold tongue\" bias in which the strip of cold SST along the eastern equatorial Pacific is too long and too cold.\r\n\r\nThe work is of practical as well as scientific interest due to the implications of the SST pattern for regional climate impacts.  These include the distribution and intensity of Pacific tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) and the effect of Pacific warming on drought in the US Southwest.  In addition, the award provides for the career development of a Postdoctoral Research Fellow (PRF), who will work with mentors Tiffany Shaw and Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This award provides support to the Ice Drilling Program (IDP) to provide community leadership and to operate and maintain a facility to support ice drilling engineering, field support, and education and outreach. The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in the four closely linked leadership goals of this project which include: 1) producing and maintaining long-term and short-term integrated science and drilling technology plans in collaboration with the U.S. and international ice coring and drilling research communities, 2) providing field support with drilling equipment and expertise to support NSF-funded science, 3) identifying new technology needs and seeking funding for technology development and acquisition, and 4) enhancing communication and information exchange related to ice coring and drilling science and technology within the US and international ice science community. These goals relate to the importance of evidence from the polar ice sheets from ice cores, subglacial bedrock cores, and boreholes to access the subglacial aqueous environment, which has led to many important discoveries that have revolutionized climate science. These discoveries have also had important impacts on policy and thus also have societal relevance. Continued U.S. scientific leadership in this area depends critically not only on the support of scientists doing this research but also on the continued support of a dedicated facility to provide the field drilling support and accomplish engineering and technology development activities. This program and its education and public outreach activities will nurture the inclusion of students of many ages, races, and genders, will help to launch graduate students into promising careers, and the resulting scientific discoveries will benefit all citizens. Achieving the goals of this project will enable the U.S. ice science research community to realize implementation of their national and internationally-coordinated scientific goals, lead the world in ice science discoveries, nurture the education and development of the next generation of scientists and engineers, and help to communicate the importance of the discoveries to all.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Measuring the spatial variation of chemical elements in soil, sediment and rock is crucial for understanding life-supporting processes in Earth’s Critical Zone – a thin near-surface zone where life, soil, water, rock, and air interact. This proposal aims to acquire a µ-XRF instrument to measure and map the spatial distribution of plant-essential nutrients (e.g., P, Ca, K) in modern and fossil soils. This instrument will also aid groundwater, sedimentology and geoarchaeology research by mapping chemical changes in minerals from aquifer sediments, flood and lake deposits, ancient river channels, and prehistoric rock quarries. The µ-XRF instrument at the University of Memphis will be used to train students and researchers residing in the broader mid-South region. This instrument, and the proposed Institute of µ-XRF at the University of Memphis, will create opportunities for students and promote diversity and inclusion through summer programs and visiting research fellows.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding how chemical elements are cycled between different Earth systems, e.g., plants, soil, rock, river and aquifer sediment, is needed to predict system behavior under environmental and climate change scenarios. A common problem in these geochemical studies is resolving spatial changes in chemical elements at the micrometer scale. Nondestructive spatial imaging of geochemistry using a µ-XRF instrument will provide a means to resolve small-scale 2- and 3-dimensional changes in chemical composition. This tool will support soil geomorphology, hydrology, and sedimentology research, providing insights into weathering processes, sediment deposition, and paleoclimate reconstruction. The µ-XRF will foster education and training for students in the economically distressed Delta Regional Authority area, benefiting early career scientists and providing research opportunities for up to 150 students over the next 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Given human’s expanding use of the ocean, there is increasing need to understand natural and anthropogenic noise impacts to sound-sensitive taxa. Understanding acoustic ecology is vital as given rates of ocean changes and the fact that science is still unraveling how marine animals use sound to communicate, detect predators, seek prey and find suitable habitat. To gain this knowledge there is a need for a cost-effective, extended-duration tool that allows researchers to easily and experimentally replay sound cues, manipulate soundscapes and introduce ‘noise’ in field-based experiments to address new questions in ocean ecology and conservation. This effort will support the build and testing of a scalable, cost-effective, ocean-ready and long-duration sound playback tool. This tool will enable scientists to gather new insight into how sound is used by and impacts diverse marine fauna. The research will focus pilot tests on coral reefs, imperiled hubs of biodiversity that support billions of USD in ecosystem services, and seek to enhance the attraction and settlement of young corals as a method to support and potentially rebuild reefs. The project will incorporate and train undergraduate and graduate students, young technicians, and engineers, including underrepresented minorities, in all aspects of this development and testing. This effort is designed to be self-sustaining so that once it is completed, other scientists and stakeholders will be able to use acoustic enrichment and new questions to support the redevelopment of reefs and conduct previously unobtainable ecosystem studies.  \r\n\r\nThe science will be piloted and optimized through beta-experiments replaying soundscapes to attract coral larvae and induce settlement onto reefs.  The team involved will leverage the emerging understanding of reef soundscapes, their own key data, and a beta-system, to enable this acoustically-mediated playback and larval settlement investigation tool. The technical components of the system will be durable and optimized for the playback of reef sounds, enhancing its dynamic range, sound propagation, and variety of sound patterns. The pilot tool will be tested and optimized at an established US Virgin Islands field station with years of measurements on soundscapes and community dynamics. Additional testing and user-feedback integrated will occur a new site in Year 2. From these calibrations, iterations and tests, the project will provide an important new natural-based instrument for the toolboxes of scientists and stakeholders to conduct novel acoustics studies surrounding the fields of marine ecology, changing oceans, physical oceanography, and broader basic ocean research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.\r\n\r\nCratons are the oldest and most stable parts of the Earth’s continents. During continental break-up or rifting events, these stable crustal areas split apart and eventually give way to magma rising from Earth’s deep interior and the formation of new crust. Volatile elements such as helium, nitrogen and carbon dioxide play an important role during all aspects of plate tectonics. Major volatiles are transported from the Earth’s surface into Earth’s interior during subduction and may accumulate below and within the stable cratons due to radiogenic production and upwelling from the mantle below. The mechanisms and time-scales of this accumulation remain poorly understood, yet are significant because these processes form reservoirs of economically valuable gases such as helium and hydrogen, and geologically important gases such as carbon dioxide. When cratons eventually break apart, these gases are released to the atmosphere and have potentially significant climatic impacts on geological time scales. The objective of this work is to determine the geological processes that control volatile production in the craton, their migration through the crust and release at the surface. The investigated field site is the area surrounding the Tanzania Craton, a type example of a stable craton surrounded by the East African Rift, and a location of intense magmatism and extensional tectonics. This particular geologic setting is ideally suited to investigate the formation processes of cratonic volatiles and their potential release mechanism due to magnetism and rifting. During the course of the project two Tanzanian students will get their Ph.D. education and experience at the Woods Hole/MIT graduate program and the University of New Mexico. The students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, data interpretation and application of these techniques for understanding the processes of reservoir formation of these economically valuable gases.     \r\n\r\nThis project is a comprehensive study of the volatile gases that are being emitted from gas and water seeps along the flanks of the Tanzanian craton - a region where the stable continental craton is actively being “cracked” by rifting and simultaneously heated by plume-induced volcanism. The overall aims are to understand: 1) the mechanisms by which gases have been produced and stored in stable cratons over >109-year timescales, and 2) how they are liberated and transported to the surface during cratonic breakup. The study primarily focuses on helium (He) and nitrogen (N2) and their isotopic characteristics, which are the main constituents of cratonic gas accumulation, but we will measure all other noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and their isotopes, CO2, CH4 (as well as their isotopes) and H2 in seeps. The PIs will use field- and lab-generated gas chemistry results to form an integrated model of gas formation and transport along the flanks of the Tanzania craton. Volatile fluxes will be calculated to understand the extent of gas release when a cratonic region is disrupted by rifting and volcanism. Determining how cratonic gases are released to the crust and eventually to the atmosphere is important for understanding volatile movements on large spatial and temporal scales. By constraining how volatiles are accumulated and released during steady-state rifting and magmatic conditions, the PIs will characterize cratonic volatile inventories and fluxes. This information will be of interest to the broader Earth science community, and provide valuable context to researchers studying the potential climatic effects when gases are abruptly released from the stable craton to the atmosphere as well as the formation of economically valuable gas reservoirs of helium and hydrogen. Two Tanzanian students will be jointly supervised by the PI’s of the award and trained in field and laboratory techniques at their respective institutions. There will be opportunity for the students to obtain in depth training in noble gas geochemistry, gas geochemistry and stable isotopes, as well as modeling approaches to understand the processes of formation of these economically valuable gas reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, data interpretation and application of these techniques for understanding the processes of reservoir formation of these economically valuable gases.     \r\n\r\nThis project is a comprehensive study of the volatile gases that are being emitted from gas and water seeps along the flanks of the Tanzanian craton - a region where the stable continental craton is actively being “cracked” by rifting and simultaneously heated by plume-induced volcanism. The overall aims are to understand: 1) the mechanisms by which gases have been produced and stored in stable cratons over >109-year timescales, and 2) how they are liberated and transported to the surface during cratonic breakup. The study primarily focuses on helium (He) and nitrogen (N2) and their isotopic characteristics, which are the main constituents of cratonic gas accumulation, but we will measure all other noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and their isotopes, CO2, CH4 (as well as their isotopes) and H2 in seeps. The PIs will use field- and lab-generated gas chemistry results to form an integrated model of gas formation and transport along the flanks of the Tanzania craton. Volatile fluxes will be calculated to understand the extent of gas release when a cratonic region is disrupted by rifting and volcanism. Determining how cratonic gases are released to the crust and eventually to the atmosphere is important for understanding volatile movements on large spatial and temporal scales. By constraining how volatiles are accumulated and released during steady-state rifting and magmatic conditions, the PIs will characterize cratonic volatile inventories and fluxes. This information will be of interest to the broader Earth science community, and provide valuable context to researchers studying the potential climatic effects when gases are abruptly released from the stable craton to the atmosphere as well as the formation of economically valuable gas reservoirs of helium and hydrogen. Two Tanzanian students will be jointly supervised by the PI’s of the award and trained in field and laboratory techniques at their respective institutions. There will be opportunity for the students to obtain in depth training in noble gas geochemistry, gas geochemistry and stable isotopes, as well as modeling approaches to understand the processes of formation of these economically valuable gas reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This grant provides three years of Community Facility Support for the Wisconsin Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer National Facility (WiscSIMS Lab). The WiscSIMS Lab performs precise and accurate analysis of isotopes in very small amounts of material to advance earth and environmental science research. These small-scale measurements can reveal hidden information about Earth processes, like the driving forces for volcanic eruptions, the speed of climatic changes, and the formation of critical-element minerals. The principal missions of the WiscSIMS Lab are to drive innovative research and to ensure that all visiting scientists, especially those funded by NSF, can obtain world-class SIMS data. The WiscSIMS Lab has been funded continuously as a National Facility since 2008 and is a leader in training in the next generation of scientists. More than 440 different researchers, including 146 student trainees and 27 postdoctoral trainees, have worked with WiscSIMS since it was established.\r\n\r\nWiscSIMS provides in situ, high spatial resolution, high-precision isotope analysis to advance geoscience research in paleoclimate, geochemistry, volcanology, geobiology, petrology, sedimentology, and tectonics. The WiscSIMS Lab is built around a large-radius, multicollector CAMECA IMS 1280 ion microprobe, analyzing primarily stable isotopes of Li, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe, but also trace elements, volatiles, and U-Pb isotopes. The WiscSIMS staff has developed state-of-the-art capabilities for precise and accurate in situ analysis of isotope ratios with small to ultra-small spot sizes. With renewed Community Facility Support, WiscSIMS will continue to make at least 50% of its beam time available each year to guest researchers. NSF projects will continue to receive the highest scheduling priority and a reduced fee rate. Community Facility Support funding will allow WiscSIMS to pay the salaries of the expert SIMS operators and support staff, who assist scientists to drive innovative applications of isotope analysis across the breadth of geoscience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This award involves a collaboration between the University of Colorado Denver and University of California Berkeley to study the ionosphere during a solar eclipse. Very low frequency radio observations will be made during the 2024 solar eclipse in the eastern United States.  A solar eclipse is a rare event in which the radiation from the sun is partially or totally obscured by the moon for a few minutes. A solar eclipse is not only spectacular to observe but also provides a rare opportunity to study the physical and chemical processes of the ionosphere. In particular, the lowest part of the ionosphere is significantly modified by the sun and is difficult to study. A solar eclipse offers the opportunity to observe a day-night-day change of the ionosphere on the scale of a few minutes.  Observations made during an eclipse therefore provide a key insight into how the sun changes the lower ionosphere. Understanding the lower ionosphere is important to improving long distant communications and understanding space weather processes that affect an increasing number of technologies.  A number of students from the diverse populations at both universities will support the effort and be trained to make low frequency radio wave observations and their interpretations. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project combines the resources of CU Denver and UC Berkeley to study the lower ionosphere during the solar eclipse of 2024 in the United States, using VLF and ELF remote sensing techniques. Three types of receiver hardware will be used to make synergistic observations during the solar eclipse events. The observations will be interpreted with numerical modeling efforts to answer outstanding questions on the dynamics of the lower ionosphere during an eclipse.  The three science questions are 1) What is the lateral and vertical structure of the ionosphere in the totality zone of the solar eclipse? 2) What are the observed ionospheric perturbations when the region of totality is near a powerful VLF transmitter? and 3) What is the lower ionosphere characteristic reaction time to a point like perturbation from the eclipse?  The specifics of the 2024 total solar eclipse bring the lunar shadow to the close vicinity of the most powerful VLF transmitter in the United States.  This offers a unique opportunity to study a solar eclipse with higher resolution and in the presence of local heating effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation’s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.\r\n\r\nThis is a project to be carried out jointly between the United States and the United Kingdom. It seeks to implement a new measurement technique called Distributed Acoustic Sensing. The technique would provide images of water temperature and current velocity fields in a cross-section delineated by an existing telecommunication and power cable laid on the sea floor off one of the Azores islands. Images would be generated with unprecedented resolution (10 m in space, minutes in time) through the development of a ‘noise interferometry’ technique as part of the Distributed Acoustic Sensing. The technique measures the cable stretching caused by pressure changes and how such cable stretching varies over time. The noise interferometry values will be compared to measurements from conventional oceanographic moorings and ocean bottom seismometers. The study will assess the noise interferometry method in several ways: quantify its skill; demonstrate its robustness to uncertainties; determine its feasibility to depict turbulence properties; and apply it to research on internal tidal fluxes around the island of Madeira. As Broader Impacts, the project will provide information with spatial and temporal resolutions that should allow improvements in the skill of climate model projections. Also, the project will strengthen a collaboration with the UK while providing training for four Naval Postgraduate School graduate students and two undergraduate interns at University of California San Diego.\r\n \r\nThis is a joint US-NSF/UK-NERC proposal to obtain high resolution (10 m in space, minutes in time) distributions of temperature (sound speed) and velocity fields above a 34-km cable laid on the seabed off Madeira Island. Distributions will be drawn by developing a noise interferometry technique, which combines acoustic and gravity wave noise interferometry methods through Distributed Acoustic Sensing. The approach measures strain and strain rate values throughout an existing telecommunication and power cable on the ocean’s bed. The noise interferometry values will be compared to measurements from conventional oceanographic moorings and ocean bottom seismometers. The study will assess the noise interferometry method in several ways: quantify its skill; demonstrate its robustness to uncertainties and variations in mechanical coupling between cables and the seabed; determine its feasibility to depict turbulent dissipation rates; and applying it to research on internal tidal fluxes interacting with the island of Madeira, and associated tidally-driven turbulence in the bottom boundary layer over the topographic slope. Results will be analyzed in the context of internal wave interactions and of bottom boundary layer properties. In terms of Broader Impacts, the project will provide information with spatial and temporal resolutions that should allow improvements in the skill of climate model projections. Also, the project will strengthen a collaboration with the UK while providing training for four Naval Postgraduate School graduate students and two undergraduate interns at University of California San Diego.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Continental-scale ice sheets in the polar regions (i.e., Antarctica and Greenland) hold 99 percent of the fresh water on Earth. These ice sheets are prone to undergoing fast changes in a shifting climate and may contribute significantly to future sea level rise. The physical properties of the ice sheets contain important information that can aid understanding of ice sheet dynamics (why they move) and provide hints on how ice sheets themselves respond to the changing climate. Therefore, making comprehensive observations of the time-dependent physical properties of the ice sheets is critical to better predict how much and how fast these systems will contribute to sea level rise. By leveraging existing seismic data, this project will aid the understanding of how seismic properties within and beneath the ice sheets change over time. Seasonal changes in subglacial conditions, revealed by seismic energy from remote earthquakes and ambient noise, are directly related to the evolution of subglacial hydrological systems. Targets of the research include near-surface seismic properties, which will reveal possible changes within and local conditions of the firn, a shallow layer used to understand long-term trends and improve regional climate models. Results from Antarctica will be compared to those from the Greenland ice sheet to isolate true seasonal signatures in the response of ice sheets in northern and southern polar regions to seasonal atmospheric and climate forcing. Further, sub-glacial solid Earth properties help constrain the geology of the ice-covered continent. In addition to the research efforts, the project will support a female graduate student, a female scientist and an early career (non-tenured) faculty, with additional educational efforts catering to the needs of K-12 and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nSeismic properties within and beneath Antarctic ice sheets reflect physical changes in firn and subglacial hydrological systems and thus contain information on how the ice sheets are changing now and may change in the future. Seismic ambient noise and teleseismic wave measurements display geographical and temporal variations of near-surface and deeper properties, described to date in polar regions such as Greenland. A systematic survey of temporal variations has not yet been performed across all of Antarctica. Preliminary findings suggest seasonal variations in seismic observations (e.g., up to ±20% annual shear velocity change), and initial comparisons between sensors and hemispheres suggest true physical changes within the ice sheet and at its base are being detected. This project will perform a comprehensive analysis of seismic data collected by more than 600 stations in Antarctica over the past two decades, focusing on seasonal and long-term temporal changes recorded in various data products from both body and surface waves. This project will investigate: 1) Body-wave receiver function waveform analysis and their vertical-to-horizontal initial amplitude ratio, a novel approach to investigate shear velocity in the top few meters to several km; 2) Surface wave analysis (horizontal-to-vertical ratios method using both ambient noise and teleseismic earthquakes); and 3) Ambient noise coda, which helps characterize subglacial hydrological systems. Notably, the first two measurements (horizontal-to-vertical ratios and radio-frequency amplitudes) will be incorporated in a novel method to constrain temporal changes in the top tens of meters of the ice sheet down to tens of kilometers depth, resolving the ice sheet base and crust below.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Climate change, erosion, and poorly suited housing pose serious threats to the infrastructure of dozens of northern Alaskan villages. In many of these communities, people must decide whether to protect in place, undertake a managed retreat, or relocate entirely. Each decision seriously impacts livelihood and well-being. This project investigates housing strategies that Alaska Native communities are using to adapt to climate change and how these strategies might be improved by involving more user perspectives in planning processes. Through outreach activities and participatory workshops, researchers will work with Alaska Native communities and with policymakers to develop, share, and evaluate possible housing solutions. This project will generate publicly accessible multimedia products to educate, engage, and disseminate design prototypes, local resources, data, and relocation planning tools. \r\n\r\nThis research explores how co-design practices are being used in infrastructural planning projects and the impact that these practices have on how communities make decisions about whether to protect in place, engage in managed retreat, or relocate. Five intersecting research objectives guide this investigation: (1) Gather insights on the experiences of residents in housing projects in recent decades, (2) Identify the specialized tools, communicative practices, and modeling activities through which housing experts design infrastructural solutions with and without Alaska Native communities, (3) Map the flow of information and expertise included in housing decisions, (4) Comparatively analyze and explore various data sets through the creation of multimodal forms for broadening participation in planning activities, and (5) Establish access to knowledge that bridges academic research, building science policies, and the rich stores of local experience. This project will generate timely scholarship on housing futures in Alaska and advance understanding of participatory climate adaptation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Climate change, erosion, and poorly suited housing pose serious threats to the infrastructure of dozens of northern Alaskan villages. In many of these communities, people must decide whether to protect in place, undertake a managed retreat, or relocate entirely. Each decision seriously impacts livelihood and well-being. This project investigates housing strategies that Alaska Native communities are using to adapt to climate change and how these strategies might be improved by involving more user perspectives in planning processes. Through outreach activities and participatory workshops, researchers will work with Alaska Native communities and with policymakers to develop, share, and evaluate possible housing solutions. This project will generate publicly accessible multimedia products to educate, engage, and disseminate design prototypes, local resources, data, and relocation planning tools. \r\n\r\nThis research explores how co-design practices are being used in infrastructural planning projects and the impact that these practices have on how communities make decisions about whether to protect in place, engage in managed retreat, or relocate. Five intersecting research objectives guide this investigation: (1) Gather insights on the experiences of residents in housing projects in recent decades, (2) Identify the specialized tools, communicative practices, and modeling activities through which housing experts design infrastructural solutions with and without Alaska Native communities, (3) Map the flow of information and expertise included in housing decisions, (4) Comparatively analyze and explore various data sets through the creation of multimodal forms for broadening participation in planning activities, and (5) Establish access to knowledge that bridges academic research, building science policies, and the rich stores of local experience. This project will generate timely scholarship on housing futures in Alaska and advance understanding of participatory climate adaptation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Part 1:  This project focuses on a group of ecologically important species of fishes which inhabit the frigid waters of Antarctica. They represent a key link in the polar food web as they are prey for penguins, seals and toothed whales. These fish have evolved in the constant, extreme cold for millions of years and therefore, are very sensitive to the increasing water temperatures associated with global warming. These studies will investigate the impacts of incremental heat exposure on the biology of these fishes by examining their ability to respond, or inability to respond, to elevated temperatures. The project will employ cutting-edge technology to examine responses at the cellular level that may help these environmentally sensitive fishes adapt to the challenges of global warming. The primary goal is to increase our collective understanding of how polar ecosystems are likely to be impacted in the coming decades.\r\n\r\nPart 2:  The proposed research is designed to use an existing bank of frozen tissues from a species of cold-adapted Antarctic fish to investigate protein-level responses to heat stress. These samples were collected earlier in the PI's career during fieldwork at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Four tissues (control as well as heat- stressed) will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize their proteome, defined as the entire complement of proteins in a sample. This includes both identification and quantification of these proteins. The goal is to determine what mechanisms of response to elevated temperature are available to the extremely cold-adapted, stenothermic fishes of Antarctica. Follow-up analyses will use immunoblotting (Western blotting) with antibodies specific to a sub-set of proteins revealed to be heat-responsive in the proteomic analyses. As this is a Mid-Career Advancement Award, training and mentorship in proteomic analyses for the PI will be supported, with time spent at the partner institution, the University of California, Davis. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nWhile there has been an increase in the use of genomic technologies to probe gene expression profiles in Antarctic species, few studies exist looking at protein level changes during exposure to heat stress in these organisms. Therefore, the proposed studies would represent a large leap forward in our understanding of how these environmentally sensitive species can, or cannot, respond at the cellular level as the Earth continues to warm and water temperatures rise. As proteins do the \"work\" in the cell, it's vital to understand which proteins are present and in what quantity and how dynamic this \"proteome\" is during stress. The proposed studies would provide this information for thousands of proteins, using already existing samples. The findings would be entirely novel and would allow us a much better picture of how animals that evolved in the cold for millions of years are likely to respond to climate change. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe PI has established relationships with several regional K-12 institutions and will continue to provide outreach in the form of classroom visits and the creation of classroom curricula. The PI has an on-going collaboration with the Oregon Coast Aquarium (Newport, OR) to create novel teaching materials for grades 6-8. The Aquarium has partners in surrounding school districts and will help disseminate videos about marine biology and climate change. Modules concerning polar species will be created under this proposal. An interactive website will be created demonstrating the Antarctic food web. All of the proteomic analyses and libraries generated under this award will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This study will investigate uranium (U) cycling in oxygen-depleted conditions on the ocean floor, the most important sink of U. Improving our understanding of U geochemistry is critical for geological applications as diverse as dating the age of rocks, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, water quality, and securing new critical mineral sources. Reconstructing the oxygen levels of ancient oceans helps to link the evolution of the environment with evolution of life on Earth and potentially on exoplanets. Interpreting tools to probe oxygen levels in the oceans through time, such as U and other elements sensitive to oxygen level, remain challenging because of the unknowns about how they behave in low-oxygen marine settings. To address this knowledge gap, this project will track the presence of a new U species, U(+V), and investigate its role in the U cycle in modern and ancient oceans. These results will provide important insights for reconstructions of oxygen of Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, as well as the global U cycle more broadly. \r\n\r\nThe host phases and speciation of U in marine settings remain largely unknown, hampering our ability to reconstruct depositional conditions. This project will investigate U burial in the most significant marine sink to characterize the relationship between U speciation, removal pathways, and whole-rock U geochemistry, including its isotope composition. This goal will be accomplished with: (1) experiments of U phases relevant to marine settings; (2) characterizing the relationship between U speciation and U geochemistry in organic-rich shales and sediments; and (3) developing an interpretive model to predict U geochemistry from contextual information. In addition to graduate training, this project will promote museum collections and science communication for Earth and environmental science majors and K-12 outreach in environmental geosciences in rural Pennsylvania and Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "A fundamental challenge in hydrology is to explain where and when different hydrologic processes occur, and how they are controlled by climate and landscape. Hydrologic processes describe how water moves through and is stored within the landscape on its path from rainfall or snowfall to river flow. Large-scale process knowledge is valuable for a wide range of applications such as designing realistic and accurate flow forecasting models, and choosing effective interventions to improve water quality. Many scientific organizations maintain intensively monitored watersheds that provide deep understanding of hydrologic processes at specific locations, but the knowledge is fragmented and difficult to integrate across regions and continents. This project will unify field hydrology studies into a global picture, by creating and exploring a searchable database of hydrologic process knowledge. The project will enable the hydrology community to apply modern, big data approaches to knowledge discovery, and to draw out emergent patterns that relate landscape organization and hydrologic function. The project team will work with undergraduate students to develop tutorials and hands-on activities to explore the database in the form of a Student Toolkit. To engage with the hydrology community and enhance the impact of the results, the project team will build a web app and online map discovery interface for the database.\r\n\r\nThe project will create a relational database to represent process knowledge, and populate the database with extensive knowledge from hundreds of experimental watersheds, using standardized workflows to maintain quality. The database will use a taxonomy of hydrologic processes to enable labelling, organizing and hierarchical searching for process information. The investigators will explore the database to synthesize global patterns of hydrologic function, to analyze how dominant processes can be explained by physical watershed features, and to reveal transitions in processes at events and seasonal timescales. They will apply the database to evaluate new generation continental-domain hydrologic models, which currently lack the process data needed to select model structure. They will test whether flow predictions improve when models accurately represent processes, and whether model sensitivity analysis identifies the same dominant processes as those found experimentally. The long-term vision for the database includes a role as “ground truth” for future far-reaching machine learning efforts such as automatic literature and data analysis for process prediction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Plant communities respond to climate change by moving and changing, but current predictions lack mechanistic connections between plant function and environmental change. Plant community responses are observed repeatedly in the fossil record, and could help predict future changes by measuring traits from plant fossils. Much effort has focused on the ways that leaves respond to and record environmental conditions. However, leaves depend on long-lived organs, such as stems, to enable plant function. This study will establish a new database dedicated to plant stem traits from fossil xylem to understand plant community responses to major intervals of ancient climate change. More broadly, this project will prepare a new generation of Earth scientists for this highly interdisciplinary work and expand participation in research through training and mentoring targeted towards underrepresented groups in paleontology through the creation of a paleontology and ecosystem modeling short course. \r\n\r\nThis project is focused on assessing water transport in the xylem of Paleozoic and Mesozoic plants as an adaptation that influenced survivorship across two major intervals of climate change: the Late Paleozoic Ice Age of the Carboniferous-Permian (~300 million years ago [Ma]) and the hothouse climate of the Triassic-Jurassic (~200 Ma). This project will focus on three specific aims: (1) establish a unified xylem fossil functional anatomy database to facilitate (2) prediction of hydraulic traits for extinct taxa and (3) integration of fossil-observed leaf and xylem traits to predict whole-plant function using a modified ecosystem process model (Paleo-BGC). Investigators will use this approach to assess extinct plant water stress and ecosystem function through periods of extreme global climate change and test the hypothesis that coordination of leaf and stem water transport traits distinguished taxa as casualties, survivors, and thrivers during floral collapse and recovery during both global cooling and warming events. This project prioritizes training a new generation of interdisciplinary Earth scientists through training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars. Additionally, a short course for underrepresented and early career scientists focused on linking paleobotany, plant physiology, and climate change will be created. Pre- and post-course summative evaluations will be applied with an aim to improve future course iterations’ delivery of climate-change-focused interdisciplinary geoscience to the target audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A Rigaku MiniFlex 6G X-ray diffractometer and an IXRF Iridium Ultra Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy System will enable mineralogical and chemical analysis to understand the cycling of metals between water, minerals, and biota. This information can help inform technologies aimed at treating environmental contaminants. This equipment acquisition will benefit science discovery and society by providing insights into biogeochemical cycling processes which in turn can improve treatment and remediation of environmental contaminants.  Increase of student engagement by providing access and training to this equipment in course work and research projects will enhance undergraduate education across Environmental Science, Biology and Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation purchased with this award will be used to examine (1) how airborne fungi produce calcium-containing minerals (2) ways for toxic lead to be stabilized in Philadelphia soils, and (3) how mineral co-precipitation of barite can remove toxic arsenic and chromium from wastewaters produced from oil and gas operations. In particular, X-ray diffraction will be used to identify minerals produced by fungi in laboratory cultures, minerals in soils collected around contaminated sites in Philadelphia, and minerals co-precipitated with contaminants from simulated fracking wastewaters. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy will be used to map the incorporation of metals into bio-precipitated minerals with fungal biomass, the location of lead in soil minerals and plants grown in contaminated soils, and to map the distribution of arsenic and chromium in barite mineral particles produced from simulated wastewater treatments. Collaborations will also be developed across the Philadelphia region with a focus on affordable, undergraduate access to instrumentation for research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and the second largest in the world, is big enough to make its own weather.  The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).\r\n\r\nThe work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.  Rainfall is a hazard as well as a resource given that much of the rain falls in severe storms, a particular hazard for the fishing fleet.  The PIs conduct public outreach regarding climate change in the region through a traveling museum exhibit to be presented at the Mayborn Museum at Baylor University and at the National Museum of Kenya.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin and one at Baylor University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and the second largest in the world, is big enough to make its own weather.  The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).\r\n\r\nThe work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.  Rainfall is a hazard as well as a resource given that much of the rain falls in severe storms, a particular hazard for the fishing fleet.  The PIs conduct public outreach regarding climate change in the region through a traveling museum exhibit to be presented at the Mayborn Museum at Baylor University and at the National Museum of Kenya.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin and one at Baylor University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "South Carolina State University (SCSU), in collaboration with over seventeen other academic institutions in South Carolina and Geogia, will organize a 1.5 days-long conference in Savannah, GA that will bring together a diverse constellation of academic, public, and private sector representatives to build leadership, enhance partnerships, and improve the capacity of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and women-only colleges in South Carolina and Georgia to diversify, strengthen, and expand a rapidly evolving geoscience workforce. Outcomes of the conference will include a report outlining gaps, challenges, and opportunities linked to preparing students at participating institutions for diverse geoscience career pathways. The report will include recommendations for academia, public, and private sectors to address those gaps, challenges, and opportunities. This project will launch the foundation for a community of practice that continues to learn and share good practices and ideas, beyond the award period.\r\n\r\nThe conference organizers will bring together faculty and administrators from HBCUs and women-only institutions in SC and GA, funding-agency representatives, and employers in private and public sectors. The goal of the conference is to 1) identify curriculum gaps and challenges linked to lack of preparation for students for geoscience jobs, 2) develop recommendations for participating institutions, employers and funding agencies to address the gaps and challenges, and 3) lay the groundwork for future collaborations. This project is jointly funded by Directorate of Geosciences' Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) and the Division of Research, Innovations, Synergies and Education (RISE), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM), in operation since 2003, is a facility jointly operated by the University of Houston and the University of California Berkeley. NCALM provides airborne laser scanning surveys, high-resolution airborne digital images, and data processing expertise to the earth science community for the creation of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) data of Earth’s surface (topography), the built-environment, and vegetation. These 3D data are used by scientists to study natural processes such as landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, the modeling of flood behavior, and storage of atmospheric carbon in forests, among many applications. NCALM is focused on three primary goals: 1) train and educate graduate students to meet the needs of industry, government, and academia; 2) advance technology that allows for the creation of high-resolution and high-accuracy 3D data; and 3) provide research-quality 3D digital data to the scientific community.\r\n \r\nUnder the current award, NCALM will continue providing the research community with research-quality elevation data of Earth’s surface (topography, vegetation, and shallow water bathymetry) and digital aerial imaging.  A key contribution of the facility has been the Seed project program for which graduate students from US institutions prepare proposals to request lidar data for their thesis or dissertation.  These requests are competitively evaluated by an independent committee based on intellectual merit and broader impacts.  NCALM will pilot activities aimed at increasing participation in the Seed program by students from minority serving institutions (MSIs). These activities include a workshop to solicit input from MSI geoscience faculty, establishment of a short-term MSI faculty-in-residence program at NCALM, and encouraging Seed project applications from underrepresented minorities. With the accelerating effects of climate change and the increase in natural hazards in the US, there is a need to rapidly acquire high-resolution topography data immediately after an extreme event. In response to this evolving need, NCALM will pilot an \"NCALM NOW\" service through which researchers can request surveys to quickly acquire perishable data immediately after events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In this Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project, the PI will join a team of researchers at the University of California Irvine in order to study the properties of ultrafine aerosol emissions from brake wear via laboratory experiments and a small-scale filter-based field campaign. Aerosol emissions from brake wear has recently been identified as a major contributor to non-exhaust related emissions from the transportation sector and with the ongoing shift to electric vehicles, the relative important of non-exhaust emissions are of growing importance. The PI will additionally collaborate with a local nonprofit organization working towards improved air quality and cleaner air as well as collaborate with filmmakers in order to produce bilingual (English and Spanish) science education videos related to this research. \r\n\r\nThe work includes three research questions: (1) What are the physiochemical properties of ultrafine particles formed from break wear? (2) How do these properties change after undergoing secondary atmospheric processing including oxidation and photodegradation? (3) Are ultrafine particles from brake wear present in ambient samples from Santa Ana, California? There are three main research approaches: (1) laboratory experiments on the formation of ultrafine particles from brake emissions; (2) the use of an oxidation flow reactor to characterize the formation of secondary species; and (3) the collection of ultrafine particles generated from brake wear emissions on filters within Santa Ana, California, and the study of their chemistry via exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Multiple instruments will be used during this project including various mass spectrometers as well as a transmission electron microscope.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Various plasma waves are excited in near-Earth space during geomagnetic storms, and the waves affect the behavior of particles carrying the ring current and the strength of the flux of energetic electrons in the radiation belts.  Ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves with frequencies below 100 mHz play an essential role in this regard, and understanding the spatial and temporal occurrence patterns and the excitation mechanism of the waves is a crucial element in magnetospheric research. The investigation focuses on a recently reported new type of compressional ULF waves in the inner magnetosphere with a symmetric (fundamental) mode structure about the magnetic equator. Antisymmetric (second harmonic) waves are commonly detected and well-documented in the literature.  The team aims to determine the relevance of drift compressional instability (DCI) to stormtime magnetospheric ULF waves. The investigation has broader impacts regarding wave-particle interactions occurring on other planets and in laboratory plasmas.  In addition, the investigation will contribute to building improved space weather models that are valuable beyond the context of basic research.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the investigation is to observationally determine whether the physical properties of symmetric ULF waves and the particle environment associated with the symmetric waves are consistent with DCI.  To this end, we will use data from the Van Allen Probes (RBSP), which include electric and magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles. With the RBSP mission providing measurements in the inner magnetosphere ( < 6) over a 7-year period (2012–2019), the data are ideal for determining the mode structure of ULF waves, their spatial and temporal distributions, and the properties of the background particles.  We will determine the mode structure by paying attention to the relation between the spacecraft latitude and the location of the equatorial node/antinode of ULF waves. The relevance of DCI to observed symmetric waves will be discussed by evaluating the theoretical instability condition using observationally determined energy and radial distance dependence of the phase space density of ions in the ring current energy range (1-300 keV). We will discuss the statistically determined spatial occurrence pattern of the waves in relation to the drift of ions injected from a nightside source region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to advance knowledge of tsunami hazards along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the main source for earthquakes and tsunamis  in the US Pacific Northwest. This work will map ancient tsunami deposits preserved in the geologic record and combine this data with advanced models to simulate tsunami impacts along the coast. These results will deepen understanding of how past earthquakes have behaved in this region. The specific focus will be on the last major earthquake in the region that occurred in the year 1700. This research will directly impact public safety and preparedness in the region. The insights gained will help to improve hazard maps, emergency and evacuation plans, building codes, and the design of tsunami evacuation structures. Furthermore, the project will support a collaboration with the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. This tribe has built North America's first free-standing tsunami evacuation tower, and the collaboration will help to advance community engagement and education regarding seismic risks. Through ths work, this project will serve as a vital investment in public safety and knowledge dissemination. \r\n  \r\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ), focusing on the seismic and tsunami activity around the year 1700 CE. To accomplish this, the team will carry out high-resolution mapping of paleotsunami deposits at two key locations along the CSZ and execute thousands of advanced tsunami inundation models. These efforts aim to test various hypotheses of what kinds of earthquake slip distributions can explain actual field observations, addressing gaps in the current understanding of tsunami deposit distribution. By employing innovative techniques such as analyzing sediment cores, microfossils, and sediment geochemistry, the results will delineate the full extent of tsunami inundation with high resolution at these new sites. This approach will help in validating or excluding different earthquake scenarios and contribute to a more precise understanding of the CSZ's seismic behavior. This research is fundamental for accurate seismic and tsunami mapping and has wide-ranging implications for practical hazard applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "For national security, it is imperative that US government agencies detect and classify potential threats as rapidly and accurately as possible. The project will contribute to this cause by delivering mathematical innovations that offer reliable predictions from machine learning algorithms, superior time resolution for surveillance data, and optimal sensor arrangements for robust dataset assembly. In the context of basic research, these contributions will further develop the mathematics of how machines sense and learn.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the following three objectives: (1) Develop theory and algorithms for transfer learning and neural networks. (2) Design optimal or nearly optimal line packings for extremely sparse signals. (3) Design optimal ensembles of equal-rank operators for dataset assembly. To this end, the research aims to solve various open problems from metric geometry and machine learning: (a) to develop new algorithms for transfer learning; (b) to explain emergent phenomena in neural networks using gradient descent trajectories; (c) to construct new line packings that achieve equality in the second Levenshtein bound; (d) to construct incoherent line packings from finite field objects; and (e) to construct highly symmetric subspace packings that are optimal with respect to spectral distance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project leverages novel converging technologies and expands blockchain technology to new healthcare domains enabling the secure exchange of confidential, precision health information such as advanced directives and life-sustaining management within and between organizations. The confidentiality, security, and efficiency of data management are critically important in advanced care and life-sustaining treatment decision pathways for ethical, clinical, regulatory, and legal reasons. The combination of the proprietary blockchain solution with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and edge computing enablement offers enhanced privacy and security, improved audit-readiness, better risk management, and superior operational efficiency. The solution functions as an overlay to legacy systems. It easily integrates with existing information management systems, in the cloud or on premise. Further, this solution is scalable, providing a competitive advantage and ease of adoption for stakeholders, including those who are seeking Web 3.0 upward compatibility.  In addition to the direct impact within this application area, the technology can have a broader positive influence on the economy and society by preventing or reducing data breaches, increasing trust and quality of life, and reducing the total cost of healthcare. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project establishes a novel, efficient, and effective solution for advanced directives and life-sustaining management, which is one of the critical areas within precision health and medicine given the highly personalized and ethically-complex nature of the application. The zero-trust solution achieves decentralized confidentiality, fine-grained access control, and robust intrusion tolerance by avoiding any single point of failure and maintaining operational efficiency. By leveraging modern cryptographic protocols, pre-built privacy-preserving smart contracts, advanced user access control overlays, support for publish/subscribe messaging patterns, integration with off-chain operations, and confidentiality-preserving machine learning models, the solution offers a unique, modular, decentralized architecture that can meet complex regulatory, privacy and security requirements. Further, the technology is specifically designed to address Internet of Things (IoT) network security and data management at scale. The project aims to reduce cyber-vulnerability, increase operational flexibility and achieve scalability that will prove beneficial to a broad array of related healthcare and precision medicine domains such as transplant services, genomic medicine, or biobanks where data confidentiality is of critical importance, especially as these are highly vulnerable to data breaches and cyberattacks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary aim of this Phase I project was to determine technical feasibility of the PARROT's supporting component technology.

The primary aim of this Phase I project was to determine technical feasibility of the PARROT's supporting component technology. The Set Point Solutions (SPS) team accomplished this by conducting a detailed study of the limitations and performance specifications of current state-of-the-art components and employment systems, modeling the design, and simulating operation in the conditions anticipated.\r\n\n\nOutdoor sports enthusiasts and public safety officials/first responders cite communication as their principal concern when conducting their activity.

         "For national security, it is imperative that US government agencies detect and classify potential threats as rapidly and accurately as possible. The project will contribute to this cause by delivering mathematical innovations that offer reliable predictions from machine learning algorithms, superior time resolution for surveillance data, and optimal sensor arrangements for robust dataset assembly. In the context of basic research, these contributions will further develop the mathematics of how machines sense and learn.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the following three objectives: (1) Develop theory and algorithms for transfer learning and neural networks. (2) Design optimal or nearly optimal line packings for extremely sparse signals. (3) Design optimal ensembles of equal-rank operators for dataset assembly. To this end, the research aims to solve various open problems from metric geometry and machine learning: (a) to develop new algorithms for transfer learning; (b) to explain emergent phenomena in neural networks using gradient descent trajectories; (c) to construct new line packings that achieve equality in the second Levenshtein bound; (d) to construct incoherent line packings from finite field objects; and (e) to construct highly symmetric subspace packings that are optimal with respect to spectral distance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Further, this solution is scalable, providing a competitive advantage and ease of adoption for stakeholders, including those who are seeking Web 3.0 upward compatibility.  In addition to the direct impact within this application area, the technology can have a broader positive influence on the economy and society by preventing or reducing data breaches, increasing trust and quality of life, and reducing the total cost of healthcare. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project establishes a novel, efficient, and effective solution for advanced directives and life-sustaining management, which is one of the critical areas within precision health and medicine given the highly personalized and ethically-complex nature of the application. The zero-trust solution achieves decentralized confidentiality, fine-grained access control, and robust intrusion tolerance by avoiding any single point of failure and maintaining operational efficiency. By leveraging modern cryptographic protocols, pre-built privacy-preserving smart contracts, advanced user access control overlays, support for publish/subscribe messaging patterns, integration with off-chain operations, and confidentiality-preserving machine learning models, the solution offers a unique, modular, decentralized architecture that can meet complex regulatory, privacy and security requirements. Further, the technology is specifically designed to address Internet of Things (IoT) network security and data management at scale. The project aims to reduce cyber-vulnerability, increase operational flexibility and achieve scalability that will prove beneficial to a broad array of related healthcare and precision medicine domains such as transplant services, genomic medicine, or biobanks where data confidentiality is of critical importance, especially as these are highly vulnerable to data breaches and cyberattacks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is in the development of a visual unilateral neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation tool for stroke patients.  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability, including the cost of healthcare services, medicines and missed days of work. Stroke related costs in the United States are around $50 billion every year. Unilateral spatial neglect (neglect) is a disabling neurocognitive impairment for stroke patients occurring in 28.60% of the stroke population.  Moreover, neglect is a strong predictor of disability, and stroke patients with neglect have longer hospital stays and receive more direct treatment time from physical and occupational therapists than individuals without neglect, culminating in significantly higher healthcare costs.  However, there is currently no commercial product targeting neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation. Current clinical gold standard neglect detection methods are affected by compensatory strategies and are not sensitive to changes in the severity of neglect; and rehabilitation techniques are not effective in reducing disability associated with neglect.  This project, through a multidisciplinary team, will address these issues while developing the proposed neglect detection, assessment, and rehabilitation technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a neglect detection, assessment and rehabilitation tool that incorporates stimulation to draw attention to the affected side of the body and environment based on the automatic detection of neglect through neurophysiology measured through electroencephalography, thereby stimulating neural networks responsible for spatial attention and perceptual processing for stroke patients. Stimulation during everyday activities with high levels of repetition is needed to promote implicit learning that supports generalization of learning and independence.  Current detection and rehabilitation methods lack the necessary precision, salience, and repetition to promote this type of learning. Due to limitations associated with these methods, there is no gold assessment for neglect or standard of care for rehabilitation of neglect in routine clinical practice. The proposed project offers a potential solution to these problems, incorporating best practices from rehabilitation intervention research and state-of-the-art technologies that will be cost-effective to be implemented in rehabilitation clinics. The proposed technology incorporates objective and reliable quantification of neglect severity and tailored sensory stimulation that is: (i) technology-driven (accurate, reliable, repetitive, cost-effective); (ii) multimodal: visual, auditory, haptic stimulation (optimizes perceptual processing); (iii) individualized to the available field of vision; and (iv) simultaneous with ``real-world'' activities of daily living .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Recent research suggests that learning about genetics during high school biology can lead to a belief that inherent differences in the genes and brains of men and women are the main causes of gender differences in behavior and intellectual abilities (a belief known as neurogenetic essentialism). This belief is implicated in lowering girls’ sense of their own STEM abilities, their feelings of belonging in STEM classes, and their interest in pursuing further education in STEM fields. The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, the University of Texas, Austin, and New York University is to answer important questions about how to teach genetics at the high school level in a manner that is scientifically accurate, but does not have these detrimental side effects. Specifically, this new line of experimental research will identify—and revise—the content in common genetics instruction that promotes the belief in neurogenetic essentialism. The proposed experiments will also explore how the beliefs of peers and teachers contribute to changes in such beliefs in students. This work has further implications for how the topic of differences between men and women is addressed during high school biology education. Furthermore, the research findings will advance theory on factors that contribute to gender disparities in STEM attitudes and aspirations. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, with co-funding by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) program. \r\n\r\nBuilding on preliminary evidence, this project aims to accomplish four key goals. First, the project will study which specific aspects of genetics instruction affect students’ beliefs in neurogenetic essentialism. Second, the project will identify the cognitive mechanisms through which these effects occur. Third, the project will uncover the downstream effects of revised genetics instructional materials on a broad range of motivational variables relevant to STEM pursuit, such as implicit person theories, sense of belonging in STEM, and interest in this domain. Fourth, the project will explore the contextual factors (e.g., teacher and peer beliefs) that may moderate or mediate how students respond to the instructional materials. The research team will develop and iteratively refine genetics educational materialsthat teach about genetic, neurological, and behavioral variation within and between sexes, as well as the social causes of such differences. The research team will then test the effectiveness of these revised materials through two large-scale randomized control trials, one targeting students directly and one targeting students’ learning via their teachers. The results of this project will produce generalizable knowledge regarding the cognitive, sociological, and educational factors that contribute to STEM gender disparities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Baccalaureate Engineering student Success and Transition (BEST) programs are holistic student success programs at four-year undergraduate universities that provide evidence-based, well-structured activities to enhance engineering students' academic and professional success in the college transition and to increase their retention in the engineering major. These programs often struggle to attract diverse students, including women, students from underrepresented minority groups, first-generation students, low-income and rural students. This project aims to examine this issue by finding the most effective methods for reaching underserved students and recruiting them to BEST programs. The project seeks to identify strategies that are successful, impactful, and sustainable. This will strengthen BEST programs, allowing them to fulfill their goals and expand further. The project will contribute to our national understanding of efficient recruitment methods and effective communication channels. Additionally, it will promote diversity in engineering education and the workforce. By recruiting more engineering students from diverse backgrounds, we can address the nation's need for a diverse engineering workforce, which is critical for the advancement of society. By implementing strategic recruitment efforts, we can uplift underserved students, their families, and their communities, and these efforts have the potential to enhance the economic growth of rural areas.\r\n \r\nThe goal of this project is to build STEM education research skills in the PI through a project that broadens participation in engineering in the U.S. via assessing different strategies to recruit underserved students (women, minorities, first-generation, low-income, and rural students) into BEST programs at 4-year universities. The study is based on the Diffusion of Innovations framework and will examine students’ awareness of BEST programs and decision-making processes about whether or not to apply to these programs through surveys and interviews. Responses will be analyzed to study the effectiveness and alignment of different recruitment methods in use by BEST programs from the perspectives of both program organizers and students. The project is national in scope and aims to include 100 BEST programs across the U.S. and more than 2000 students via surveys and interviews with program leaders, and BEST program participants and prospective participants. Knowledge generated on effective recruitment strategies from this project will contribute to the literature base, broadening its impact and helping to tackle the challenges of low enrollment of underserved students in BEST programs, while supporting the creation and continuation of student success programs. This project also trains new STEM education researchers (PI and supported students) to enhance their capacity to conduct rigorous research in STEM education. The project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program, which is designed to build investigators' capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "There is widespread interest in broadening participation in computer science (CS) education to improve academic and economic outcomes for individual students and for the country as a whole. To accomplish this, states have increasingly adopted and invested in policies to expand the availability of CS courses, to encourage student participation in CS courses, and to ensure the availability of qualified CS teachers. However, evidence is needed on the extent to which these policies have succeeded. By combining data on states' adoptions of CS education policies with data on high schools and institutions of higher education, this project aims to provide evidence on how those policies affect outcomes of interest to policymakers. Results from this project will provide evidence pointing to specific policy levers that are effective for expanding CS education and for addressing inequities that have been well documented in CS education.\r\n\r\nThis project will be a nationwide analysis of the effects of states' CS education policies and represents a research partnership between the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Kansas State University. It will use a longitudinal data set spanning the years 2000-2022. This data set will be unique in two ways. First, it will include a novel data set on the timing of states' adoptions of specific CS education policies (e.g., requiring that all high schools offer CS or creating preservice CS teacher preparation programs). Second, policy adoption data will be combined with longitudinal administrative data on CS high school course taking, undergraduate enrollments, current high school teachers, and teacher certification that is available either publicly or in state data warehouses. Once combined, this data set will allow specific state policies to be statistically linked to specific CS educational outcomes. Specifically, the project will answer four research questions: To what extent do state CS education policies affect (1) course taking in high school; (2) enrollment and graduation in CS and CS-related majors; (3) the production of CS teachers; and (4) the qualifications and characteristics of high school CS teachers? Answering these questions will take advantage of the fact that different states adopted different policies at different times and will involve recent advancements in \"event study\" modeling that allows for causal inferences about both the short- and long-term impacts of policies. This will provide the most rigorous causal evidence to date about the impacts of policies on broadening participation in CS and how those impacts vary over time. These results will be disseminated through conference presentations, journal articles, essays in practice- and policy-oriented outlets, and engagement with meetings of state and local policymakers and school administrators. This project is funded through the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "An award is made to Kansas State University (in collaboration with USDA Agricultural Research Service and Harvey Mudd College) to design, build, and test a digital AC-DC electropenetrograph to study the real-time feeding behaviors of blood-feeding arthropods, using ticks as the model system. Ticks and other blood-feeding arthropods transmit a wide array of medically- and veterinary-important pathogens, many of these increasingly exacerbated by climate change. An important obstacle to basic research on tick feeding behavior is the inability to capture observations and statistically analyze details of tick feeding behavior because it is masked below the surface of the host’s skin. The challenge is further compounded by the incredibly long durations over which ticks feed (~7 to 10 days for adult ticks). To address this methodological deficit, this project will develop a user- and application-friendly digital AC-DC electropenetrograph which will enable researchers to readily investigate these hidden behaviors in unprecedented detail. This project brings together a transdisciplinary team of scientists that will collectively support the training of 12 to 20 undergraduates and a postdoctoral researcher, giving them opportunities to explore this burgeoning area of research interest from diverse perspectives of engineering, computer science, and biology. Project undergraduates and the postdoctoral researcher will work in teams mentored and guided by project scientists. Trainees, recruited as broadly as possible, will interact with scientists from academia, government, and industry, affording them opportunities to investigate future career paths. Trainees will be involved in both intellectual and physical aspects of this research and will participate in the iterative evaluation of their designs tested using a combination of arthropod species: ticks (project model blood-feeding arthropod) and aphids (gold standard insect for electropenetrography research). Project scientists and trainees will also have opportunity to share project goals with broader audiences through development and delivery of related content and experiential opportunities through community and science communication engagement platforms and events (e.g. Kansas Science Fair).\r\n\r\nElectropenetrography (EPG) is a transformational technology that has been used for nearly 65 years to study the masked feeding behaviors of piercing-sucking, plant-feeding insects. However, such a means of studying the basic behaviors of blood-feeding arthropods in real time, including ticks that feed for extreme durations (days to weeks), has eluded biologists for decades. Despite initial success with tick and mosquito feeding recordings using the existing analog AC-DC electropenetrograph, this instrumentation presents notable physical limitations for working with blood-feeding arthropods on vertebrate hosts. Developing a more user- and application-friendly digital AC-DC electropenetrograph will solve this challenge and enable ground-breaking investigations to detect, characterize, and quantify the progressive and highly coordinated feeding behaviors performed by ticks and other blood-feeding arthropods. Hypothesis-driven studies can then be performed to study basic feeding biology and investigate how host factors, vector characteristics, pathogens, and chemical interventions specifically modify hidden arthropod blood-feeding behaviors. In this project, the digital AC-DC electropenetrograph will be evaluated over the course of three scientific objectives: (i) Design and build a prototype digital AC-DC electropenetrograph and associated software to record tick feeding on an unsedated live host; (ii) Iteratively evaluate versions of the prototype instrument with live ticks and live host, and modify prototype as needed; and, (iii) Demonstrate the usability of the digital AC-DC electropenetrograph to record and statistically compare tick feeding behaviors upon applications of a behavior-interdicting compound. Successful completion of this research will deliver a user-friendly, commercializable instrument and associated software that will: 1) accelerate expansion of electropenetrography from plant-feeding insects into blood-feeding arthropods, 2) ensure the continued availability of this crucial infrastructure through an evolved digital instrument design, and 3) allow faster high-throughput uses through development-associated machine learning software.  Project outcomes will include development of a user-friendly, digital AC-DC electropenetrograph and supporting ‘arthropod species flexible’ software. This novel research instrument will spur new opportunity for a broad community of researchers interested in improving the resiliency of animal and plant agriculture from blood-feeding and plant feeding arthropods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Generalization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has become a challenging problem. Many DNNs do not remain predictive when the distribution of data changes or there are small disturbances in the input. A major reason for this challenge is shortcut learning, which refer to decisions based on relationships in the data that exist, but which are not causal. These decisions fail when the model is transferred to real-world scenarios because of spurious correlations. This project is to investigate shortcut identification and mitigation in deep learning. The successful outcome of this research will lead to advances in providing theoretical understandings, and developing robust and generalizable DNN algorithms to analyze datasets with various types of shortcuts. The education program that integrates machine learning, industrial engineering, and health informatics is to train students with essential data analytics tools in information systems, to attract, mentor and retain members from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to systematically investigate the identification and mitigation of shortcut features from a data-centric perspective to facilitate the generalization of deep learning. The developed data-centric mechanisms could be directly adopted in real-world data analytics systems. Specifically, this project studies shortcut identification and detection at different levels, including instance-, feature-, and task-levels, and then performs shortcut mitigation through data augmentation and training regularization. This project also demonstrates how the proposed research innovations could be embedded in two DNN based real medical informatics systems. The proposed frameworks uncover the intrinsic properties of shortcut learning by calibrating shortcut features from different categories of distribution shift, and enable their comprehension and adoption for researchers and practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. NSF LIGO’s detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in coincidence with electromagnetic signals from gamma-rays to radio opened a window into the interiors of neutron stars. These stars contain matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang. Long-lived continuous gravitational waves associated with pulsars and supernova remnants and short bursts associated with gamma-ray flares of highly magnetized neutron stars, once detected, will yield even more information on neutron star interiors. The planned Cosmic Explorer detector will push the frontiers forward by enabling detection of many neutron star mergers and probably a variety of other signals. The science goals of this award are to conduct cutting edge searches for these novel signals and improve the extraction of astrophysical information from present and future signals. This award supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic Serving Institution. Students will be trained not only in gravitational physics, data analysis, and astrophysics, but in cutting edge computational and statistical techniques that are transferable to many areas of science and technology. This award also supports public outreach through the Cosmic Explorer web site.\r\n\r\nThe main research activity of this award is searches for continuous gravitational waves from young neutron stars, including r-mode oscillations of known pulsars as well as searches of supernova remnants and other likely locations of non-pulsing neutron stars.  This award also contributes to searches for a variety of signals including neutron star binary mergers and bursts associated with magnetar flares and to the extraction of astrophysical information from detections present and future. In preparation for the detection of non-merger signals the award supports exploration of detectability and what can be learned about neutron stars now and in the era of Cosmic Explorer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Brain tumors are among the most fatal cancers, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. In the United States alone, each year thousands of adults and children receive a primary brain tumor diagnosis. A key focus for oncologists, neurologists, and other scientists involved in the field is in determining the specific anatomical origin site of the tumor. Knowing this site might help in gaining insights in how the tumor behaves, in predicting the symptoms it is likely to cause, and in identifying genetic syndromes that have a high association with brain tumors. Therefore, this source information can be an important aid in the early detection of brain cancer. This project studies a reliable and efficient inversion algorithm called Deep Quasi-Reversibility Method (DQRM) that can quickly reconstruct the primary tumor’s location. By actively involving undergraduate students in research activities and fostering collaborations between institutions, the project will contribute to the well-being of individuals affected by brain tumors as well as help to cultivate a skilled STEM workforce. The project is based at a long-established HBCU, thus providing an opportunity to broadening research participating in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project involves numerical and theoretical studies of the proposed DQRM for solving the source localization oncological question with different levels of complexity. The DQRM is a combination of a variational quasi-reversibility (QR) method and a deep learning mesh-free-based algorithm.  The design brings together techniques of computational mathematics, partial differential equations, and machine learning to fast deliver a reliable and accurate quasi-solution. On one hand, the variational QR approach can overcome localized features, highly dynamic nonlinearities, and the inherent exponential instability of the reconstruction process. On the other, the deep learning approach handles the curse of dimensionality and the costs associated with data measurement. The first objective of the project is to study the effectiveness of the inverse solver in tackling the quasi-linear parabolic models associated with the evolutionary dynamics of tumor cells. The second is to investigate the applicability of the algorithm by incorporating an advanced tumor growth model that considers factors such as age, size, and spatial structure. The theoretical theme is centered around the convergence of a neural network approximator towards the quasi-solution.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded in part by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Excellence in Research (HBCU-EiR) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "In general, complex flows - those observed in supersonic-to-hypersonic combustion and propulsion, fusion technologies, and astrophysics - involve multi-material mixing and span a broad range of space and time scales. Fluids participating in such flows have a wide range of molar masses, and in many cases, the flow is highly compressible. It is still a challenge for current engineering tools to predict the key flow physics that arise due to the compressibility and large material property variations. A stronger fundamental understanding of these effects on turbulent flows will significantly increase our ability to model the flow physics accurately, such as the rate of turbulent mixing that occurs in complex multi-material flows, and to perform numerical simulations of such flows with a decreased computational expense. These gained abilities will have a direct impact on the improvement and development of many high-tech products in the space, energy, and defense industries. Therefore, the focus of the proposed study is to quantify the coupled large molar-mass ratio and compressibility effects on the gravitationally driven turbulent flows. The project will also deliver an educational component by generating content for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses. It will also support outreach activities to promote interest in fluid dynamics and turbulence, and more broadly in STEM among local middle-school students.\r\n\r\nMulti-material turbulence has so far mostly been studied with quasi-incompressible and Boussinesq flows with small variations in material properties. The proposed project aims to describe flow compressibility effects on Rayleigh-Taylor unstable turbulent mixing with large density variations beyond the Boussinesq approximation and the incompressible assumption. Novel direct numerical simulations of buoyancy-driven flow that resolve all spatial and temporal scales will be performed at large density ratios (>2) with highly compressible fluids using the adaptive mesh refinement to optimally deploy computational resources. Unique statistical tools will be developed to quantify the non-Boussinesq turbulent compressible mixing dynamics. The proposed simulations and statistical analyses will be used to establish a deeper understanding of turbulence transition for non-Boussinesq flows, and in particular, the small-scale flow topology of the compressible active-scalar mixing. In addition, the findings of this research are expected to inform new sub-grid-scale models and strategies to decrease the computational cost of the multi-physics complex fluid-flow simulations and validate the reduced-order models for these complex flows.

         "A major goal of modern probability is to understand the macroscopic behavior of large random systems. This project studies a class of random growth models taking place in different geometric settings and will develop new tools effective for these structures; the aim is to understand the behavior of these systems and the impact of the underlying geometry on this behavior. These systems, for example, might be used to model the growth of cancer along a wall or a cylinder. \r\n\r\nThe extensive algebraic structure underlying integrable or exactly solvable models without boundary has been successfully used to study a variety of probabilistic questions for these models. Many of these models are expected to exhibit universality, meaning that the behavior studied should occur in a wide variety of other models. However, once non-trivial boundary conditions are imposed, our understanding is incomplete. The proposal aims to develop a better understanding of the algebraic structures involved once boundary conditions are imposed and to use this structure to attack probabilistic problems. In particular, the work aims to find new hidden symmetries for these models and to establish asymptotic results via new exact formulas for models with boundary. Undergraduate students will participate in the research, continuing the awardee's record of student mentorship, and the work will be disseminated at seminars and conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Cilia are flexible hair-like appendages commonly used to create fluid motion in biological systems, facilitating swimming, feeding, reproduction, and other functional behaviors. Typical cilia are tens of microns long, but ctenophores (comb jellies) use cilia at much larger scales—around a millimeter in length. At small scales, ciliary flow is highly constrained by fluid viscosity. However, at larger scales, inertia becomes more important, leading to quantitative and qualitative differences in the velocities and forces produced by the cilia. These differences will be explored with a combination of laboratory experiments and computational simulations, using ctenophores as a model system for large-scale cilia. A better understanding of the fluid dynamics of cilia across scales will provide new tools to ask and answer questions related to biology, ecology, and the fundamental physics of how flexible structures create flow across scales. This knowledge may lead to new developments in engineering, including bioinspired devices, sensors, and robots. The project will also include the development of several educational components, including a new module on the viscous-inertial transition for high school physics students and outreach activities for young women interested in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to understand the physical principles that govern ciliary flows from low to intermediate Reynolds numbers. This study will explicitly examine the effects of substrate geometry and deformability on ciliary flows. A combined experimental-numerical approach will be used to investigate hydrodynamic interactions of multiple flexible propulsors at low-to-intermediate Reynolds numbers and develop useful scaling laws. The experimental approach will employ both planar and volumetric particle image velocimetry to visualize the flows generated by living ctenophores across a range of animal and propulsor sizes. The material properties of the ciliary substrate (mesoglea) will also be characterized during the investigation. These results will guide the development of a scalable computational fluid dynamics model, which will be used to investigate the larger parameter space of ciliary flow generation across scales. The project will focus on the effects of three key variables: (i) propulsor kinematics, including the degree of bending and spatiotemporal asymmetry; (ii) substrate geometry, from flat to curved; and (iii) substrate deformability, from rigid to highly deformable. This integrated approach will enable an in-depth investigation of how flexible structures generate flow across the viscous-inertial transition, and the development of broadly applicable scaling principles to guide future technology development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in advancing education, but it remains difficult to conduct large-scale research that yields the strongest results for students and teachers. SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights’ privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and different educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on the inclusion of students, educators, and researchers from diverse and representative backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. \r\n \r\nSafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from diverse platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists and data stewards in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., demographics, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas, contexts, and with different demographic groups. Enclaves enable researchers to ask and answer equity-centered learning questions because their analyses can account for socio-demographic variables in large-scale datasets from real-world learning applications. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and democratize access to STEM research opportunities, particularly for scholars from underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today’s classroom and tomorrow’s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend the range of on-hand wireless communications devices to austere and remote environments. Public safety agencies will now be able to utilize available resources more efficiently, precisely geolocating distressed individuals and/or connecting individuals in need with specific resources and personnel to facilitate their rescue. The propeller-enabled Projectile Assisted Repeater/Relay Of Transmissions (PARROT) technology will benefit the civilian market that requires communication in remote locations or emergency situations. Potential customers include individuals whose vocation or vacation takes them into austere locations where the ability to communicate effectively may be compromised. Additionally, the PARROT would be a lifesaving piece of equipment for individuals whose work often requires them to be in areas lacking robust or functioning communication infrastructure: commercial truck drivers, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responders, search and rescue teams, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project highlights how communications solutions historically evolved by modulating the specific frequency range, whereas the approach applied to solving this problem is to allow the user to prescribe the location of a relay and rapidly introduce that physical relay (capable of loitering for sufficient time to allow for two-way communications) into their environment. The envisioned device could utilize existing tools to deploy its innovative technology. Additional variants could be developed as part of all-in-one kits supplied to outdoors enthusiasts. The principal scientific and engineering research objectives are to engineer, develop, and design electronic components small enough to fit in the desired form factor, yet rugged enough to withstand the significant set-back forces associated with ballistic, short-tube launches. Computer aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes will be used to model, prototype, test, and evaluate the design. Once that task is completed, the device will be able to safeguard the lives of first responders and outdoors enthusiasts globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat.

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy.

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Non-technical description\r\nMarine invertebrates often have mutually beneficial partnerships with microorganisms that biosynthesize compounds with nutritive or defensive functions and are integral for survival. Additionally, these “natural products” often have bioactive properties with human health applications fighting infection or different types of cancer. This project focuses on the ascidian (“sea squirt”) Synoicum adareanum, found in the Anvers Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula, and was recently discovered to contain high levels of a natural product, palmerolide A (palA) in its tissues. The microorganism that produces palA is a new bacterial species, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, found in a persistent partnership with the sea squirt. There is still much to be learned about the fundamental properties of this sea squirt-microbe-palA system including the geographical range of the animal-microbe partnership, its chemical and microbiome complexity and diversity, and the biological effect of palA in the sea squirt. To address these questions, this multidisciplinary research team will investigate the sea squirt-microbiome partnership in the Antarctic Peninsula and McMurdo Sound regions of the Ross Sea using a state-of-the-art strategy that will advance our understanding of the structural and functional features of the sea squirt and microbiome in detail, and reveal the roles that the palA natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The project will broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry. In addition, advancing the understanding of palA and its biological properties may be of future benefit to biomedicine and human health.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nMarine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes can produce bioactive natural products; in fact, >600 such compounds have been identified in species from polar waters. Although such compounds are typically hypothesized to serve ecological roles in host survival through deterring predation, fouling, and microbial infection, in most cases neither the producing organism nor the genome-encoded biosynthetic enzymes are known. This project will study an emerging biosynthetic system from a polar ascidian-microbe association that produces palA, a natural product with bioactivity against the proton-pumping enzyme V-type H+-ATPase (VHA). The objectives include: (i) Determining the microbiome composition, metabolome complexity, palA levels, and mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. adareanum morphotypes at sites in the Antarctic Peninsula and in McMurdo Sound, (ii) Characterizing the Synoicum microbiome using a multi-omics strategy, and (iii) Assessing the potential for co-occurrence of Ca. S. palmerolidicus-palA-VHA in host tissues, and (iv) exploring the role of palA in modulating VHA activity in vivo and its effects on ascidian-microbe ecophysiology. Through a coupled study of palA-producing and non-producing S. adareanum specimens, structural and functional features of the ascidian microbiome metagenome will be characterized to better understand the relationship between predicted secondary metabolite pathways and whether they are expressed in situ using a paired metatranscriptome sequencing and secondary metabolite detection strategy. Combined with tissue co-localization results, functional ecophysiological assays aim to determine the roles that the natural product plays in the host ecology in its native Antarctic seafloor habitat. The contributions of the project will inform this intimate host-microbial association in which the ascidian host bioaccumulates VHA-inhibiting palA, yet its geo-spatial distribution, cellular localization, ecological and physiological role(s) are not known. In addition to elucidating the ecophysiological roles of palA in their native ascidian-microbe association, the results will contribute to the success of translational science, which aligns with NSF’s interests in promoting basic research that leads to advances in Biotechnology and Bioeconomy. The project will also broaden diversity and provide new opportunities for early career students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in field and laboratory-based research that builds an integrative understanding of Antarctic marine biology, ecology, physiology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project aims to serve the national interest by applying machine learning (ML) methods to improve engineering student persistence. The increasing demand for a diverse, qualified engineering workforce requires an improvement in undergraduate program persistence rates, especially for underrepresented and minoritized students. This Engaged Student Learning Level 2 project intends to apply well-established predictive ML methods and cutting-edge ML explanation methods to identify and predict which students might leave and why. The project team plans to identify tailored interventions to meet individual student needs. This project will test the viability and variability of various ML methods and generalize the methodology for other universities. The proposed project has the potential to generate knowledge and streamline a methodology for the identification of individualized interventions for engineering persistence. \r\n\r\nThe project is grounded in expectancy-value theory. The proposed methodology will help engineering education researchers to begin intervening in the first year to help at-risk students persist. This project also has the potential to have broad impacts on computer science communities which require real-world applications of emerging tools. Project findings will be presented at the American Society of Engineering Education annual conference and Frontiers in Education annual conference. In addition, all python code for each stage will be made available through the Open Science Foundation. The codes will be accompanied with detailed instructions for using the proposed methodology with new data. The proposed methods to improve engineering persistence potentially have broad impacts in a local, nation-wide, or global scale. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. PhDs in psychology and neuroscience are awarded to individuals from underrepresented groups in proportions far lower than is their representation in the overall population. The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (UW) seeks to address this problem by adopting a core motivating premise of the REU mechanism, which is that Research Experience is one of the most effective avenues for attracting students to and retaining them in science and engineering, and for preparing them for careers in these fields. Indeed, 79% of PREP’s 99 alumni from the years 2011-2023 are currently working as Professors or postdoctoral researchers, matriculating in a graduate program in a STEM discipline, engaged in postbac research activities in preparation for applying to graduate school, finishing up their undergraduate studies in a STEM field of study, or applying STEM-related skills in a nonacademic job. PREP is held for 10 weeks each the summer, during which students engage in immersive mentored research coupled with hands-on classroom training in data science, and professional development. Each PREP student carries out their research project in a laboratory in, or affiliated with, the Department of Psychology. They receive mentorship from the Principal Investigator of their lab, and day-to-day supervision from a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow in that lab. Weekly data science workshops are led by faculty and trainees of the UW’s NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program that focuses on learning, understanding, cognition, intelligence, and data-science (LUCID). Weekly professional development sessions are led by a rotating set of faculty from the Department of Psychology.\r\n\r\nPREP’s focus is on integrating principles and methods of data science into the study of psychology and neuroscience. This was developed as a result of polling faculty at the UW, \"What attributes do you seek when you are recruiting graduate students for your own lab?\" A response that was common across every faculty member polled was prior experience with technical skills. The specifics varied from lab to lab, but facility with programming, such as in MATLAB, python, and/or the R environment, was the most frequently listed desideratum. More broadly, a trend in almost all domains of psychology and neuroscience is an increased emphasis on data science. In some domains it’s data mining and meta analysis. In some, it’s large-scale data collection, such as internet-based studies with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In neuroscience, it’s the fact that individual neural data sets can, in-and-of themselves, constitute a kind of big data to which methods from machine learning and other branches of engineering are increasingly being applied. The program’s mentoring organizational structure pairs each PREP student with three mentors: a faculty mentor, who is a tenured/tenure-track/or PI-status faculty member at the Departments of Psychology or Psychiatry or one of LUCID’s other core departments (Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Educational Psychology); a research mentor, who is the graduate student or postdoctoral fellow who is responsible for day-to-day research mentoring of the PREP student; and an alumni mentor, an alumna/us of PREP.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "The rapid invasion of three large constrictor species—boa constrictors, reticulated pythons, and ball pythons—into Puerto Rico over the past few decades presents a critical threat to the island's ecosystems. The Caribbean Islands Biodiversity Hotspot, already vulnerable due to global connectivity and climate change, now faces an unprecedented ecological challenge. This research, funded by the Rapid Response Research (RAPID) mechanism, addresses the urgent need to understand the adaptive ecological dynamics of these invaders in real time. The project aims to capture crucial data on the genomes, microbiomes, and pathogens of these large constrictors, informing immediate conservation efforts. This project focuses on sampling source and leading-edge populations of the constrictor species to document potential fungal and viral pathogens, stomach contents, life-history data, and tissue samples for genomic, metagenomic, microbial, and transcriptomic sequencing. Additionally, permanent voucher specimens will be collected for cataloging and monitoring invasion dynamics. Through this project Puerto Rican undergraduate researchers and conservation practitioners will gain valuable training and local community members will be involved in public education on the threats of invasive species.\r\n\r\nThe invasion dynamics of large constrictors in Puerto Rico impact ecosystems and pose imminent threats to native endangered species, necessitating urgent action. The intellectual merit of this study lies in its unique opportunity to collect data that will allow researchers to understand the evolutionary processes associated with rapid adaptation and niche competition in a three-species invasion scenario. By bridging knowledge gaps in the adaptive potential and pathogen co-evolution of these invaders, the research contributes to a broader understanding of global invasion dynamics. The collected data will provide critical insights into the distribution and diversity of the invaders, known to feed on federally endangered birds, and help in real-time understanding of pathogen threats. The project not only informs conservation strategies for agencies like USFWS, DNRA, and local stakeholders but also emphasizes science education through community engagement, field trips, workshops, and outreach materials. This inclusive approach fosters stewardship for Puerto Rico's biodiversity and provides valuable opportunities for underrepresented undergraduate researchers. In summary, this project stands to contribute significantly to advancing scientific knowledge on invasion dynamics, offering insights applicable to global management strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
